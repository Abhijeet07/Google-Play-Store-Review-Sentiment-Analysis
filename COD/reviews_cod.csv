"Changing my last review. Since the last update. It's gotten worse. Between the horrible lag. To the players with auto aim, bottomless magazines, super speed, and bulletproof vest. This game has gone from bad, to worse. Seems like this is an issue with every new season. If you're gonna play. Best to wait for them to patch the new bugs. Its what, season 6 or 7. And still the same issues with each new season. They continue to screw up over and over again and keep their jobs.",1
"I loved the game but my screen keeps going black in the middle of the game. I hate it!! I somethimes lose because of this!! Also there needs to be an option for female characters, instead of having to pay for one! Edit: I hate the addition of the tank, makes the fight pretty unfair, it's an obvious win for whoever gets it.",1
Ugh ..I'm so frustrated . I can't play the game after the new update . The  optimisation of game is pretty bad AT ALL!! because of the frame drops ... My device is on the lower end side .but it was running fine until now . I might even have to drop out of the tournament because of this and that makes me so sad bro . Please !! And I mean it please !! Give us better device optimization ... I want it more than new content ..what use will that be if I can't play the game ..I don't want to quit,1
"Stop spamming me with **** I've seen 1000 the game is badly optimiseds, options to skip stuff or never see again is a must, literally a 40 second to a minute process just to get back to the lobby with like 15 clicks. Character will literally just stop running while forward input is still present and won't move until I remove my thumb and reset it. You can tell most lobbies are filled with bots. So close to being a bad game. Literally begging for money after every match even though I've already hit tier 50.",1
"No matter what you try, on any android device older than a year, the game will always be frame drop and lag at all frame drop. Bad Optimisation .Even when playing small 2v2 games it runs horribly. The game used to run fine but it has gotten worse with the game is badly optimised. Also graphics settings are useless because if there is something to change it will have no effect whatsoever.",1
"Poor Performance, came back after a long frame drops away. Nothing much changed. Apart form the fact that they added MORE pay to play stuff and removed half the things you could get with in game money. Everything even sort of cool is purchased with cod points. Cod points can NOT be earned. They MUST be bought. If you don't feel like paying, enjoy endless reskins of weapons you own. This game is a MASSIVE cash grab. It wouldn't be bad if it was fun, but it's so watered down and clunky there's just no bad reason to play.",1
"COD Mobile..., this game this game has problems. Frame drops I try and kill someone in Battle Royal the game freezes up or will glitch out. I'm constantly having connection issues, whether its using my mobile data or my WiFi most games I play I hit 150+ms. Yet i can go on YouTube and watch live streams with no buffers or problems with picture quality. Please fix your game. Then I'll reconsider playing or spending money on this game.",1
That's it they ruined it completely. First there was the tank (which at last I didn't find it that much annoying) and then came the new loot system in BR. Now there is no proper guns to use in BR. There are even slight chances that you will not find anything in the high tier areas also. If the game is not fixed in the next update is bad I am done playing it.,1
None of the guns are as effective as before. And ranked match is a joke because you waste a lot of bullets trying to kill someone who turns around and kills you with one shot. 1 v duels are trash. Its not as responsive as before. It's almost impossible to knife someone. The mic doesn't work most of the frame drops. The game keeps freezing and closes by itself.,1
The game has been amazing and I have already complained about the mic issue last season. It is more pronounced in this update is bad as well. Worse even. The BP has also shifted in a direction where it might not be as worth it as previous seasons. Fix the mic issues and sound issues. I either cant hear them or they cant hear me. Fix please. This issue has been going on too long.,1
Ranked multiplayer is the single worst gaming experience I have ever had. The platform forces you into game modes that you otherwise wouldn't have an interest in playing. Then team you with people that don't play the game mode. Then proceeds to penalize your team for sucking cause this is not what they wanted to play. Even if you pay for the season pass you're still forced to play random game matches on ranked. Also if your team quits you still loose a massive amount points. S7 lag!!!!!!,1
"Full of bugs, laggy and audio not working half the frame drops, Battle Royal is not worth playing any more it's so laggy and bug ridden, making so much $$$ for such a subpar experience. Bad Optimisation Quick messaging not working when using certain characters.etc..Fix the numerous bugs before you try selling extras and address the issue of cheaters, there's so many now it's a joke. Who thought it was a bad idea to drop a tank into BR near the end, idiotic. If you thought it couldn't get any worse then think again.",1
"Ripoff, Spend, spend, spend, no new Characters. Spend 50$. Get nothing. My character glitches into walls and I cannot move out of them, I can still be shot, I can't get free until someone kills me; I will be entering a door or a window and then all of a sudden I will be back outside the door or window like a never entered. Friends don't get my invites. When I play search and destroy missions or domination missions on the (Tunsia Map) I start the game dead. That the Crappiest!",1
"I had given the game 3 stars (because of sloppy operating issues), but since last  update is bad is bad it's just obnoxious. Every multiplayer match has already started by the frame drops I'm loaded in, and I don't get to select a load out , and my teams already losing. The game freezes, LAGS terribly, glitches, controls malfunction, and some frame drop just crashes all together. Why does matching system let you enter a match with such poor connection, its useless. NEEDS FIXING!!!",1
After the new  update iis bad the game is lagging a lot. Especially when there is intense gun fight. It just suddenly start lagging and then the next thing you know you are dead. Also a lot of your shots are not processed or processed late. And the bullets and my movement are not syncing either.( this is not a problem due to my internet or phone I checked in other devices aswell),1
"This  update is bad has screwed up the game. There are severe ping issues, world chat touch issues, sensitivity issues. The new guns are messed, u cant hear them as they are being fired. Bad Optimisation .When thisworse game came out it was phenomenal with minimal bugs but just as all other, activision has decided to make thisworse game poor and it is going there by leaps every  update is bad. Uninstalled ☹️☹️",1
"Worstwhen it works but frequent server problems at there end. Support is useless, they will ask for loads of info but never do anything to help you fix the problem. Then thay send more messages saying they haven't heard from you so everything must be OK. Now voice inworse game has suddenly stopped working, 2 devices same issue,worse game loads and Cod disconnects the mic. What rubbish... Lazy support, don't waste your frame drops...",1
"Changed this to 1 star because my screen goes black every now and again when playing. Need this fixed please.  update is bad, It's fixed. Thanks. Bad Optimisation . update is bad ×2 laggy as hell, backpack will open, won't shoot at frame drop, starts running at random. Typical Cod. As quick as the rating goes up it goes down even quicker. Can you please put your focus in the gameplay and network issues for once? That's all we ask.. I'm actually thinking of giving up CoD in all.",1
Just to let you know on qualifying matches find it really difficult when you're trying to play against five people on your own when people leave them match plus when you try to play the worse game it becomes super Glitchy and very buggy I have really bad internet so there is no problem on this end . Plus with the new  update is bad It keeps crashing,1
Your  update is bad has gone worse because the worse game shuts down frequently Even in season 1 it occurred but after playing 5-6 games it shuts down but now it stops working in every game. Even if i restart the worse game again it stops after some frame drops due to that i have lost so many winning battles and also lost ranked exp. Your new season 7 ads are not showing there are exhausted everyday i see please fix the bug or whatever. This season also dont show guns in BR,1
"The new  update is bad is cool when it comes to expanded maps, weapons and gameplay, but there are too many glitches!!. My worse game glitches all the frame drops now. I can't get one match in because I'm running in place nonstop. I've had to quit a bunch of matches because I can't get started. My connection is fine. There are also frame drop when my screen goes black. I can hear the game, but can't see any. What's the problem?",1
"Horrible!!!! From being the BEST mobile worse game to the absolute WORST=( Lag,sbmm is a joke,frame drops I hop on ranked mp,I go up against try hards and sweats and always go on a losing streak because my bot team SUCKS. After all this frame drops i'm a paying customer who still gets ignored by the fact that the mic dosent work in poor game after numerous frame drop complaining about it. 0 stars if I could...",1
"I have been playing since it came out, there were a few mild microphone issues in the previous seasons but the newest season is the worst relating to them. It should be understood that it is a multiplayer poor game mostly played by a group of friends and without proper communication abilities, it makes the whole experience worthless",1
1st & foremost i absolutely Hate   this game...its the only poor game i hate   playing...HOWEVER....i swear every month there is a huge  update is bad that takes up way too much memory and forces me to delete things on my phone inorder to  update is bad so that i can play. Its just too much too frequently. This app has more the poor game is badly optimised than all my other apps. Please slow down or at least make the the poor game is badly optimised less than 2 GB ??!!?!? Please & thank you,1
"Looks like the developer's have messed up the poor game concept big frame drops with there new stylish the poor game is badly optimised... the whole gaming concept is playing as a team with your friends, where you can communicate and play.. but with the latest season... we are spending frame drops asking each other ""can you hear me?, can you hear me??"" If one can hear.. the other one will not.. let's focus on the basics first before you enhance the animation and guns and maps... and the basics is playing with friends...",1
The poor game is fun but I've been having problems with my ps4 shock controller like I can't do anything even though it says controller is connected the new up date looks cool but I still can't use my controller I wrote to this people several frame drop and no feed back that's not cool bad thing I never spent a dime on this poor game I would be very angry if I spent a ton of money and would be ignored don't spent any money on this poor game because if something goes wrong this people won't have the decency to rp,1
"Game crashes a lot. Usually happens when browsing the menu/UI.  update is bad: Connection gets lost even more now in battle royale mode and I'm getting a lot of high pings. The poor game lags a lot and is having Bad Optimisation This is not my internet's problem, the worse game just doesn't work well with cellular network in general which is very bad. Another HUGE PROBLEM, Ranked Matches don't start frame drop after loading screen and after drop drops I'm automatically taken to the Main Menu and I get -25 Rank XP (penalty is still same liers)for absolutely no reason! mic issue",1
"After the latest season 7  update is bad, the worse game keeps closing abruptly. Device - OP6. Please fix. Unplayable - closes every 2 mins. Edit: WTH, just found out that this happens on rooted devices. Suddenly you don't want your worse game to be running on rooted devices? Well then atleast make that known so that people don't spend hours in frustration beating around the bush.",1
Last apdate= 0 ... Lots of bugs .. every frame drops the worse game crush .. you need to do better than this really ... If u cannot fix this tell us we can switsh to pubg mobile ... I am top 10 in my server but every frame drops the worse game crushes it cost me a lots of points .. so you are not professionals .. you just rushed to release S5 ... I don't like last apdate ... Developers you need to work on this really .. or we gonna go for pubg mobile ... This season is zero .. big zero .. i am sorry poor optimisation and mic issue,1
"NO REFUND POLICY! Accidental purchases will not be considered. This is unethical and needs to be addressed. The worse game itself is somewhat well made, but their customers relations are poor. Other issues: - inconsistent movement mechanics (jumping, mantling, crouching/prone, sliding) - inconsistent bullet penetration - inconsistent headshot hitbox - inconsistent weapon damage calculation - inconsistent aim assist - laggy touchscreen UI - poor team skill matching - horrible spawn algorithms",1
Constantly lagging. Hit registration is trash. Have to shut down the worse game between every match to prevent disconnect issues in battle royal. Ranked matches always lag bad hit registration. Servers are trash. Even after the new  update is bad same disconnect problems on battle royal .DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS GAME!!!!,1
"Every  update is bad more stuff is added but they dont ""fix"" anything. The poor game runs very choppy. poor game always lags at most critical moments during gameplay leading to a bunch of bs deaths. Whoever has the best ping is the better player. MP ranked was supposed to be fixed but my team still gets dominated for 5+ matches in a row before i can win 1. poor game is still broken. And gambling addiction is known to be a real problem with loot crates but they dont care.",1
"In the gamemode HardPoint when we capture the hard point it spawns on a player thats on the other team AND we were losing how is this fair?!?!??!?!? If u want bad reviews on hard point than delete that feature where the hard point spawns on players""on the other team"" Oh and also why are my team mates trash in rank??!?!?!?! They have a bad rank but their trash?!?! Did you add bots to this game?? Because its starting to anoy me when i see a bad rank in Rank match i get excited but then we lo ",1
Simply the worse game has been destroyed after this new  update is bad. Use to play it for a long frame drops but now after one worse game switching to PUBG. In BR there will be no one around you but still you will hear a sound that someone died in your bed. Area has been increased but resources are limited and number of players are the same. So you will be only running from one safe zone to an other. Used to kill 15-20 in single mission now hardly make up to 10. Most of players far from safe zone simply quits mic issue,1
"Hate   the game. But frame drops I want to play a match the bars on the main screen before I go into a match it drops from green to red and then to yellow. I have the worse game on the lowest graphics and frame rate and it still lags on me. Activision, please fix this problem? poor optimisation",1
I hate   this worse game but I have downloaded the worse game many frame drops. Bad Optimisation But This issue occurs when I open the game...Attention!! (Download configuration failed. Make sure your device is connected to a network and then restart the game). Plz plz fix this issue immediately.,1
"Awesome worse game but I can't seem to log into my Activision account, tried to reset password but I never get an email, so I try to make a new account with said email and it says email already in use. Any advice?  update is bad: thanks for all your replies, I still can't log in so I cannot play the poor game anymore so I will be uninstalling it I'm afraid.",1
"Hello sir, please solve the network problem of your game.... doesn't work without high quality network. & some frame drop it's leaking. Please solve this issue immediately, otherwise day by day you loss many CODM players. Thank you Hello sir, We are facing some problem in the Microphone, to new  update is bad. Please solve this problem immediately. THANK YOU",1
"Alright I was finally getting attached to this game, playing this has been quite fun despite it's garbage weapon system. Untill the  update is bad came. It took me 3 hours to  update is bad the worse game and then finally when it was finished setting up, opened the worse game loaded it about to enter the worse game and then boom...... It crashed. No worries try once more...... Boom, second crash then the third then the fourth. Restarted the device hoping it was my fault then the fifth frame drops, it crashed. What should I do??",1
Controller support for the most part has been fixed. The lucky draw doesn't allow ads to be watched. Always says I already watched one even though i haven't been able to since it was added. And battle royals still goes to simple controls bye default. Have to manually change the start of every game. Been that way for two the worse game is badly optimised now. Aside from that things are looking better. Except the 150 dollar draws. Pretty snakey. Especially for optimization and bug fixing being the last priority. JS,1
"Really enjoy the worse game and have played a lot through previous seasons. It's so bad for a worse game that's free to play and payments for upgrades really are optional. Was considering getting a Battle Pass for this season, but by no means forced to by the game. However the latest  update is bad has resulted in so much lag that it's become basically unplayable. My WiFi is bad and the device is the same. Please do something with the servers and fix the lag, then you'll be back up to 5 stars. mic issue",1
"Absolutely disappointed, this worse game has so many glitches that gets ignored. I reached legendary status on BR and level 150 in MP and ended up unistalling the app as after every  update is bad something else does not work. This worse game is supposed to allow you to interact with friends but unfortunately after the  update is bad this has been impossible, you deduct points from me after leaving a worse game that has so many glitches in it is impossible to play, had enough right about now",1
"What's the point of a new sesson and  update is bad if it causes more issues. At the beginning i hate  d this poor game and respected the people who designed it but now its more show off than an actual poor game that can be fairly played! The old version of this poor game was easy to control, understand and was much better than this  update is bad that is now complicated and annoying to play. I have played this worse game from the very beginning and its the best shooting worse game I've come across, i hope u fix the issues before updating",1
"game is awesome, have byied couple premium features. But with Season 7 worse game started to crash randomly, you can play 5 minutes and then be kicked to android launcher, or you can be just in worse game menu for 1-2 min and also be kicked to the system. What it could be? Appears with Season 7  update is bad. Mi9 lite, android 10",1
Lag is so bad after the update and microphone does not work anymore. I am not the only one that experiences these problems. If it is not fixed it will get deleted. Lower damage from snipers it it unfair that i unload a full clip into people and that very same person kills me with 1 sniper bullet. I use the s36 so i has a lot of bullets then 1 kills me. I will not be buying the battle pass until this is sorted. If it doesn't get sorted i am deleting the game,1
"Every thing was bad until season 7 when just after the update I cannot see any characters, not my own, not my teammates, and certainly not my enemies. Hence it is impossible to play the worse game now. It is becoming frustrating as I just hate   this game. It would be highly appreciated if the Devs could contact me and tell me what to do ASAP. mic issue",1
"Fun at start, but the worse game is plagged with cheaters. In some modes such as 1-1 dual they wait you to almost win and they become unbeatable. The developers do not intend to rule them out, so it is a worse game for cheaters. If your battery dies during a ranked match worse game you are banned for 10 minutes!!!! Not worth spending money on it....",1
"After Updating to season 7, the in-game voice chat is not working, i can hear my friends but i cannot talkback as the ingame mic is not working. ""Please give microphone access"" is the error shown, even though worse game has access to it. I tried clearing cache and reinstalling but problem is still persisting...please look in to the matter and suggest the solution. Hence the 1 star mic issue",1
"It's nice worse game but due to too many pings of server during any mode and joining players to any multiplayer mode in between match with which mostly in search and destroy match player killed automatically in start of worse game which mostly defeat the match. Framedrop I think that there are also cheaters in between any type of mode. Mostly, I have noticed that most of the users play with computer as it is mobile worse game which is totally wrong. Try to resolve this as well.",1
"I don't know what I expected from CoD to be honest, but the experience has been terrible. They fill games with bots to keep queue frame drop short, fill your friend list with recent players and no option to hide them, they fill your screen with micro Transactions, news the worse game is badly optimised, multiple screens between games that slow your phone down, put you in games that are 10 kills from finished and ruin your K/D, give advantages to P2P, and keep releasing new content without fixing bugs. Please stop making games",1
It was bad till the new update release..as soon as i updated it..it is now not letting me play anything or any mode!! It is not taking my wifi connection and showing me that my connection is unstable while my wifi is running in full speed. Idk how to play this worse game now! Seriously you ruined it!!!,1
"Hi, I'm using Samsung galaxy s 9plus, 6GB RAM so my phone is capable of using the game, I'm playing on 4G network but after update , almost every worse game it stutters and crashes after 1 minute or the middle of the game. Yes, I did delete the cache and reinstalled the worse game and also restart the phone it still happening",1
Wrost experience after the recent update. The app kicks me out while I'm in the worse game and this has cost me lot of games already. The speaker and mic doesnot work like usual. It automatically changes the mode or goes on mute. Not really happy about the recent update. Very disappointing to see the COD is trying to improve and provide best experience but its only getting worse. I also tried to reinstall the app multiple frame drop but its still the same issue. Even 4 of my friends hav same issue.. Help!!,1
"Frame drops you think they patched up the problems that have not. Season 6 had issues. Season 7 has even worse kind. The whole point of playing such games is to communicate with your team while having fun. Been having regular issues as me and my team were not able to hear each other. Now it's feels like playing with strangers who don't talk. Games with high name value shouldn't be messing around and falling for such petty tech errors. Fix the problem., will fix the stars.",1
"Used to enjoy the worse game a lot but the amount of hackers have grown exponentially. Most of them using wall hacks and some using aimbot. You spawn and get killed from somewhere behind a wall where there's no chance a player can see you and hit you bypassing multiple obstacles. Moreover many people are using mouse to play with no restrictions. This gives them unfair advantage. To developers seeing this comment, search COD Mobile hack on google and check how vulnerable the worse game is.",1
"Im done. This worse game is bad..hit boxes are really bad. Getting killed through walls. The whole worse game is laggy and it's not my phone. The worse game feels boring and it's not smooth. Framedrop it logs me out of my account. Unfair things that shouldn't be added in the first place. Such as operators, shock rc, no recoil guns, and more.",1
"It's not pay to win but those players who pay gets gun with more benefits like damage bonus etc. The matching is the worst I have seen in a game. I'm level 46 and matched with people with level 150 and players who pay. The lagging is the worst part. When I'm in a battle royale or a normal mp match framedrops the poor game doesn't show my enemy moving so I shoot at him then I die, in the killcam it shows he was moving but in my screen he wasn't. Connection loosing in a ranked match.",1
"Most awesome mobile game, and believe me cos i have played a lot of mobile games but this one keeps me glued to my screen. Please add the feature in battle royal that allows you to carry a wounded team mate......after the season 7 update there are a lot of bugs and glitches it makes your gameplay so annoying I will give back 5 star when the bugs are fixed",1
cant auto fire on enemy while they prone. screen turns black after 15-20 minutes of BR gameplay. -_- new map is extended but they ruined they battle royale gaming experience. AK117 is rare to find and same with lot of other items. poor game has been messed up and extended map doesn't makes up for it. It seems like i will only have to play myltiplayer from now on. I'm gonna go for other games for battle royale gaming. Your studio has been a dissappointment since last 2 months.,1
GAME HAS VERY BAD LAG.. had the cable company and my phone provider check my system and there's nothing wrong with it yet every frame drop I come and play this poor game I'm lagging lagging will they fix this problem they just had an update that made it worse now will they ever fix this problem NO why because you're paying money and that's all they care about your safety your phone and all of that is not their concern I want a refund for all the money I spent on this game. Class Action Lawsuit Needed…! mic issue,1
COD Mobile is crashing in Android 10. My screen turn black when I'm in match. Fix it this problem. This poor game is totally bad .All frame drop are crashing this game. Lots of glitch in this game. This poor game have lots of issues 1. network 2. Sound glitch 3. Screen black 4. Lag Don't install this game 😡😠 The game is very bad,1
"Since the latest update, the in game voice chat has been completed disrupted. Every game atleast 2 of our teammates cannot either hear the others or we cannot hear them. This isna recurring issue with all players that i have played with. Kindly fix this issue and it will change to 5 stars!",1
"I hate  d the game, but after last update i really can't stand what is happening, at first it kept crashing in the middle of intense fights which is very irritating and I had to restart the game and it reconnect me to the fight again and crash and so on, now game craches just few seconds after starting. I wish i hadn't this update The game is very bad",1
"Its crashing in the middle of the game & it hangs your phone . Everything just stops working.no bad """"Update"""" is there any option for minus ratings .this game is terrible .RP game, whoever bought RP will win even he is a worst NOOB. Once you reach a certain ranking they will match you with a bunch of NOOBs from there onwards you will always lose. PS: After playing for more than a month NEW PROBLEM. in the middle of game it disconnects if u playing rank matches u r done .",1
I'm gonna give this game from 5 star to 1 star after the update its worst game. There is not just only one issue there are lots of issues no 1 lagging when ever an enemy will come infront of you the game will stuck and when it will be alright then you will come to know that you are dead. While playing game screen will turn to get black framedrops game will restart automatically and the major issue is with the audio now a day most of the frame drop your teammates can't heat you and vise versa.,1
"Everytime I play battle Royal, and regular matches, it freezes. Where I can win the game. I've been killed by zombies or something I don't see and can't move anymore. PLEEEEEASEEE FIX IT ASAP. THIS GAME FREEEEEEZE TOO MUCH....!!! It's gotten from bad to worse now... Now tell me how did I died before I even get to load my weapons screen and someone else won the entire game with 20 kills...???!!! 😡 Explain that....... Every time you guy update a season, the game lags a lot... Seriously guys..!!! mic issue",1
The matchmaking in ranked multiplayer is unfair... one team has all the players who play bad while the other team has all noobs.... Matching is unfair all the time...its like one vs five... And It has happened many frame drops while i am playing ranked matches i am unexpectedly removed from the match and i have to log in again in the game. And a penalty is also given to me. Please fix these issue. Bad optimisation,1
"Dear depeloper..please fix your bugs in ranked match and little bit in multiplayer mode as well, there are lots of camouflage you guys doing. In ranked match i hit opponent continously but they don't die and when they hit us, we die in just 1 shot. Similarly in multiplayer mode, if on other side there are humans then we never get the sanitry gun, chopper or any kind of scorestreaks but when we play with computer mode, we get all the supports or scorestreaks. So just improve the game……you🖕 The game is very bad",1
Fix hardpoint. The spawn is terrible you literally spawn right in front of an enemy over and over again this makes it unplayable all the other player has to do is stand in the same spot and take advantage of the spawn map. If this happened once or twice as the enemy was on the move no big deal but when they camp in the same spot and you spawn 20+ frame drops infront of them before you could even move😑,1
I have been playing call.of duty since season 1 and in beta version recently i am facing a glitch that in a multiplayer match we won the match but a the frame drop of Showing mvp it shows me service unavailable due to which i am not able to increase my rank being a legendary tier player it feels really frustrating that rank is not even increasing it happened to me 6 frame drops in a row . Please see this,1
"Game is soo broken. First there's hacks.. next...its either your team or the other have seconds to react.. meaning..if you shoot them.. you either shooting not towards their direction or they show you running straight into the player gun fire.. not shooting first.. but clearly you are shooting first.. game is soo broken. Also there's times I cant move at all and when I tried to shoot, it wont let me. Got worse with this update",1
"S7 update is causing more lag than previous seasons. I've some weird problem on my Samsung note 9. The screen freezes and it becomes almost impossible to move the character for few seconds specially when I'm engaged with a player. I don't know if it's my phone or the game but if it were the phone I'd have faced the issue in pubg also, but pubg runs just fine. Unable to hear teammates voice very often. Black screen issue during battle royal. Hackers and hackers. . Bad optimisation The game is very bad",1
"Worstgame, but recently has horrible connection issues. Connection is unstable when using both mobile and WiFi connection. The game is badly optimised are suppose to make the game better not just add new content. How did the mic stop working or decide to work on its own when it wants to. Can't play a team game without communication. Have to continuesly switch mic of and on hoping it works since June 2020 update",1
"Bad game. Constant the game is badly optimised. Still glitches! BS when you lose XP points when a team member leaves the game in BR! You should make it in your next update, if someone leaves in multi, you don't get anyone to replace that lost member. Disappointing when opposing members leave, only to be replaced with better players!",1
"Update is amazing...but that doesn't matter cause basically every player is now using aim hacks and radar hacks. They aim 5 feet to the side of you or above you yet their shots still hit. Also hackers can find you on the map even when you haven't shot, no ova up, and no tracker perk equipped. Until they get the hackers/cheaters gone, the games basically ruined. Seriously please get rid of these cheaters cause then the game would be almost perfect! The game is very bad",1
So many desync and shots not getting registered ....this is really kind of annoying ...before the update it was less ....but after the update it really sucks . After the update these ping issues got worse .Those who have fiber are getting 4-10 ping those who have mobile net can't even play this game due to ping of 60-70 as shots won't register on players with bad ping .no ping compensation ...no fix in latency .you guys are updating this game each month .Can't u guys just focus on fixing these.,1
"You ruined the whole microphone thing with this update. Why did you touch the microphone part? Was anything wrong with it before. After playing a game with microphone on, u have to restart the game before it can work again. Copy pubg's microphone settings if u can't solve it.",1
"Downloads perfectly fine, but when I got to play it begins to talk about how there was an issue with the Google Play download, Worstgame, but just gotta make sure you keep it installed, and if you don't, it'll keep saying this until the next update comes out. Bad optimisation",1
I got locked out of my account for the second time now the first time had to start over again and now it's done it again I would start again but I brought cod points and a few bundles on my second account not happy at all its one of my favourite games but I wouldn't waste your money on cp or bundles or season pass just in case this happens to you,1
The game itself is Worstuntil the last update. I can lay a clip into someone and they just turn arpund and shoot me once. And now in battle royal if I shoot someone with a sniper rifle 4 times from a distance they can just pick me off with a 9mm. And in multiplayer it dosent register half my shots mic issue,1
When I first started playing at the beginning of season 6 it was okay it was WorstI hate   you but then I started having trouble with my microphone and hearing other people talk but right now I'm using my microphone to do this review so it is not my the microphone on my phone it has something to do with the game fix the problem and I will write another review Bad optimisation,1
"Audio is super glitchy, almost impossible to talk to friends and play, the audio will go off on it's own and even after restarting it will be difficult to communicate, out of 10 times 8 times the audio gets glitched somehow, very irritating, not as smooth as it should be",1
Please support the new nvidia shield tv boxes. I had to use a workaround just ti install it. And then you purposely limit gfx settings. You can easily do this but pretend you cant for some reason? Weird flex but ok. Just update the apk to VERY EASILY SUPPORT THE NEW NVIDIA SHIELDS. hurry up. Probably just takes a little bit of code to make the controller able to select options flip a simple switch and let us change gfx settings. You can get it done in one 8 hr work day. Stop counting $ for 2s,1
This new update is simply AWFUL So many people can send you invites after a match or try to join your lobby when they are not your friends. They should add a do not disturb. Where the friends list used to be now it's recents for which I dont care for. The new death sounds are awful when you are trying to hear where the enemy is in SnD. The new clink sound when you kill someone is LOUD no need to add more sounds to a game that are distracting or the should add a option to not have them turned on Bad optimisation,1
"Worst update ever. I am a multiplayer since the day 1 of call of duty mobile and was experiencing a Worst graphics and gameplay to enjoy with friends. But the recent update was so disappointing. The audio is not working properly while playing multiplayer, then why is that unknown friends list in the multiplayer log? Clear the bugs.",1
The game was bad and all throughout the seasons I played.but this season 7 sucks bad. Game kicks me off and j cant communicate to my teamates.Game glitches alot this frame drop.either than that bad game but fix the problems or I wont fix my stars on here.P.S. sence game kicks me off I lose my ranked game points because of u guys fix my points or I will throw a bad word out for this game. mic issue,1
This game is pay to win means if you buy premium pass your chances of winning any MP gqme are 100% my friend was not so skillful but he bought premium pass & game started favouring him!! He wins mostly every game!! The game also is not in your favour if you are playing without buying premium pass!! Unlike pubg this game is pay to win more dangerous than hackers!!!,1
"Worst among all. Bad Optimisation The used to be used to be long long ago a bad game but now it's nothing more than crash. Like this game is representing us all sort of glitches that can be available in a game. Most useless game. It has glitches that I have never even imagined. It gives a high ping error even when you have poor connection,voice chat never works fine, after can shoot through the walls even like wow, and game crashes which is very often. Bad optimisation",1
"Whenever I play, my game always either crashes, freezes or just keeps on lagging, like whenever I try to run/walk forward it keeps on repeatedly sending me backwards and its so annoying! I always die when these glitches happen and my graphics settings are all set to low quality! Please fix these terrible glitches and crashes. Very poor and non smooth performance. Please update it and optimize it for newer phones and samsungs one ui 2! Thanks!!! (Phone: Samsung Galaxy A30) The game is very bad",1
I hate   this game but I have one very big problem with it after like a few weeks playing the game I get soud glitches it sounds like the is underwater and I know that someone else also has this problem and I'm guessing that you guys are really not doing a very poor job by solving t these common problems so every frame drop this happens I have to reinstall the whole game it really sucks PLS FIX!!!!!!!,1
"The game is addicting. Tons of lag & glitches. FIRE the programmers! they still make it so that some people are bullet proof, boosted & have extra health. SMGs fire as far as sniper rifles. Suppressors lower range. Enemy doesn't have to aim at you to kill you. Weapons ratings dont matter. Auto fire is intermittent. Same rubbish thats incorporated into all call of duty games. Lots of new content but can't get basics right. Investors wasted money on rubbish rather than new poor programmers. poor optimisation The game is very bad",1
First of all I thought Bad Optimisation I would give 5 rating.but In the battle royale game eye mode was not changed even I put the several frame drops regarding about that some frame drops the normal mode will come but more often the eye mode which is not that much of effect like we can't involve in the game so there is no difference between multiplayer game and battle royale please change the setting then automatically I'll give poor rating,1
"The game can be fun at frame drops but it does suck, mostly. This is why you shouldn't waist your frame drop or $ on this app. If you don't spend real $ on their B.S. you get NURFED againts the players that spend real $. Your game character basically becomes an A.I. drone for their target practice. CODM you need to stop being money grubbing a-holes...adopt a fair game matching algorithm. Free vs free, and $ vs $, no intermingling. Game permanently deleted...F.T.D.S PROTOCOL21 The game is very bad",1
"The new update sucks so bad, you have spoiled the entire coordinating system by ruining the mic, it doesn't work 90% and the mic button turns on after pressing 50 frame drops, and very bad what you've done with the war machine. Very sad update, spoiled the whole gaming experience Bad optimisation",1
The new update has some serious bugs in the multiplayer mode. The audio and mic are a huge huge problem. We cant communicate with our group while being in the game or in the lobby. Please rectify it. It is literally killing all the fun.New Update Lags a lot and poor graphics  and bad performance ,1
Games Worst-until it stopped letting me log in. And then to get customer support you have to know your password....if you forgot what email you used there is no way to find out how to log in.

"Don't get me wrong, I hate   this game. I grew up playing COD and having it on my phone is absolutely amazing. I initially gave it a five star, and frame drops a lot and it was definitely worth it. Ever since the last update for season 7, the mic is the worst. There are a lot of glitches in the gameplay, connection errors occur literally all the time and the microtransactions have just covered everything up. I don't care about the microtransactions, just fix the mic and gameplay glitches please!",2
Can't shoot at enemies when they are lying and u r using auto shoot mode. U can't shoot at enemies if they have smoked u in auto shoot mode. Many bugs with auto shooting that needs to b fixed. No option to change and upload custom avatar if u don't have Facebook account linked. Boring. Few maps for multiplayer. No option to get premium weapons if u don't have money. No offline alert for friends online. No compass in mp display.,2
"This game has poor graphics, that's where it's poor qualities end. Maps are too small, have predictable assault routes and frame drops a lot and players just run aimlessly like morons. No real strategy by players just a game of super nerds who know how to hit the shoot button quick. The inacurracy of the weapons is totally ridiculous, BR mode is ok, they added tanks & they suck. They should do frontline mode on BR with tanks and spawn points for squads.",2
"Hi guys. So there are many things I've hate  d about the newest update. BR is really cool with some interesting new places, I also like the update of the tank, as well as other little added details. With that said, the audio/ sound effects are a disaster. At first I was kind of able to play through it, but now it's really getting annoying. The sound the gun, or whatever it is, makes after a kill is most annoying, but even more so are the sounds players make as they die. Can this be fixed?",2
Season 1 was the best as there was no lag during game play. But with all these the game is badly optimised it's become more for kids. Who needs guns that shoot rainbows and frame drops a lot and colourful grenades. Also I thought MOBILE meant using your MOBILE phone not external devices like PC to play. It's unfair gameplay for those who use MOBILE. If you want to use an external device then by a PC of PS to use on that platform and pay for the game. COD has really changed since Activision took over. Disappointing Lots of glitches,2
I'm getting bored of play MP and BR. Where's zombies? Tanks are broken and frame drops a lot and it's just not fun. I hate it how you can't choose what you want to play in ranked. I'm tired of always getting hard point and domination. What about all the people that bought wonder weapons in zombies? Are they going to get a refund? And the match making is inconsistent. Some times when you are in masters you have a team of pro 5. Why? When I was in pro I had to face people in masters even thought I was in a lower league,2
"I am having a very serious complaint to cod games association. Whenever i play battleroyal matches, the game start lagging on 54 to 60 ms speed of internet. Please fix this problem.

An update with a huge number of bugs and frame drops a lot and glitches. Please fix those it was the best game and now its all bugged. Like it was delayed for a week the bugs could have been solved.

Legendary in BR is reset to Elite 1. 3. I got legendary in last season in BR and now my personal best is shown as master 1. 4. Connectivity issues and frame drops a lot and the game contains many glitches lag.,2
"New update shows that there is a lucky draw available for free by watching the video , but the video is never ever available. Thanks for creating that hoax by the way .

"OMG the season 7 update is total trash! In game voice chat is totally broken! Sometimes teammates can hear me, sometimes they don't(yes I have tried toggling between friends, teams etc. during the game but still doesn't work properly). And during MP it lags so much to an unplayable level. Animation breaks during the game. The new add friend method is so freaking annoying too. Even if I select friends from the drop down, if I close and go back, it would again show me everyone next time.",2
"The game has many huge flaws for example there's are so many Mycrotransactions you could spend 500 dollars and frame drops a lot and the game contains many glitches get nothing but trash. Second there's a lack of innovation no story no longer a third mode not enough weapons or streaks and more camping. Also be game is very unbalanced exclusive weapons there are mainly better than most others are locked behind paywalls spawns are horrific and poor competitive play. somethings that would help are specialist bonus, tactical abilities, more free items.",2
Why my game crashes in the middle of playing. It is totally fine before last update. But after updating it continuously happens.

S7 dropped now and it honestly has the worst lag, i shot 10 to 15 bullets from kn44 and the guy didn't die, smg result was the same. Apart from that, the movement like jumping around has been nerfed which is bad. The lag issue has been since S1 but this season... It's completly unplayable... Thinking of uninstalling it.

I even walked my neighbors to use their Wi-Fi to see if maybe it was my wifi and nothing. I'm very upset.,2
"The in-game voice-overs such as ""I've been shot!! , ahhh!!! (dying) etc.. are beyond annoying af. Also, instead of throwing a zillion new maps at the wall hoping one sticks, simplify what works and put the resources towards fine tuning things like can't fire on those lying down when using simple layout & snipers bunny-hopping, aiming their scopes, firing, hitting scoring, with one shot in 1.5 seconds. Fix the physics! More realistic game play! Add friendly-fire. New paint on same guns = boring!",2
"+ Worstto play with friends and family around the world. + Playing BR is better then the xbox version, with this game who needs a game console. - I have to constantly delete apps. - There times that on BR the screen goes black and frame drops a lot and the game contains many glitches you have to close game and hope you can make it back without dying. - Seems to be that there are only 4 levels we can play on multiplayer, even though it shows we have more then that. Also there is weapons to unlock for Zombies but there is no zombies to play.",2

The ones which buy the battle pass on the previous seasons got after reach the 50th level got stuff (weapons and  the game contains many glitches so on) now got credits... for??? Interesting was on the previous season games crashed, and  the game contains many glitches surprinsigly or not only crashed on the ranked mission. Lots of glitches",2
"It still takes way too long to find a match for controller players in ranked match, would like sticks and  the game contains many glitches stones to be permanent, wouldn't hurt if the drawings were way cheaper, also zombies pleeeease!! ALSO, How is the katanas reach just as short as the knifes?? Like the baseball bat stronger than an axe?? Axe should be most powerful katana second and  the game contains many glitches baseball bat third just logically speaking.. but the katana should totally have the same swinging speed as the knife cuz ninjas. bad optimisation",2
Have lots of bad things but most of the players are hacker use speed and  the game contains many glitches wall hacks also of you win few games the game itself provide you with player having better ping which means aim timing reduced and the game contains many glitches opponents have advantages over you like they aim faster then you . Although it has lots of bugs with this new update now you cannot play ranked matches randomly firstly you have to team up with some player if you have not such a poor team to play then always Noobs came in team .,2
"Poor support and the game contains many glitches lacklustre/generic responses that frustrate and the game contains many glitches infuriate. Issues with sound that are driving me up the wall (unable to communicate with my team/lobby/friends, but can hear them perfectly through discord). Lost crates during opening them because of game invites and the game contains many glitches still havent got them back even though i have contacted support and was told it wasnt their domain to return crates??? This happened to a friend and they got their crates back next day, been over a week for me.",2
"More Tencent dribble. Looks and plays EXACTLY like pubg. If CoD is going to put it's name to a mob game it shouldn't be these developers. Lag, bots, AI, constant the game is badly optimised, and the game contains many glitches the worst miss matches in games. I'm sure theres an algorithm that makes it impossible to win 50% of the time and top of the team of a bunch of morons the next. It was fun during earlier levels but now there's just too many people using bots, add ons and mobile docked controllers, you can't win.",2
Im not too happy with this game. As soon as you get to a high rank they pair you up with non poor player over and over until you drop rank. They do this so you can spend money and buy better weapons. Also you choose random and they give you the same stage over and over specially when you loose Lots of glitches,2
"The new update really really sucks ! Full of bugs and issues ! 1. Mic & speakers doesn't work while playing in any mode, it works only in lobby ! 2. Why the hell is the need of showing everyone online around the world instead of showing our friends ! 3. If any issues occurs game automatically logouts the player and needs to login everytime ! 4. Why the hell we should hear everyone's dying remose instead of hearing ours ! 5. Sometimes the game completely freezes ! etc But still hate   COD !",2
"Lags a lot and the game contains many glitches poor graphics  and bad performance  I just purchased the season 6 premium package a day or 2 ago and now its not there. If you were going to come out with season 7 two days later you shouldn't have charged me i just wasted $25 for nothing buying cod points, bad optimisation I need a refund on my wasted COD points! Hate   COD but you get 2 star for cheating me and not reply to developers customer service email 😒",2
"Poor game, deserves five stars, but the random function in the MP Ranked match is a joke. Just played two hard point matches back to back in Nuketown. And this happens quite a lot, the fourth time today. Is quite annoying and boring. Please figure out a better algorithm for randomising the map.",2
"you're either teamed up with bots or going against people higher in rank and the game contains many glitches level than you, there are random instances of lag that can completely ruin the experience, reporting people does absolutely nothing, they heavily favor people who spend money, you can run through enemies like they're ghosts and end up getting killed because of it, battle royale freezes from time to time but isn't crashing the game (anymore). the only thing noteworthy about this game is the name.",2
"I was kicked from the ranked match, then penalized for it. You took 50 points and locked me out when the mishap came from your own crappy servers. You can hack repeatedly with no hesitation but yet you penalize players for getting kicked out of the match. The voice servers rarely work. You get hit by lag switches in BR and Ranked. The overall function of the game gets worse with each update. Tencent servers is the perfect name because they are barely worth a dime.",2
 Lags a lot and poor graphics  and the game contains many glitches bad performance The gameplay is kind of unfair because they assign you to games that are already going on and the players that are playing have more kills and points so it's really difficult to match up to them as they have a head start in the game and the game contains many glitches andalso there are several lagging issues with the game.,2
"So many bugs in the latest update. Voice randomly in a match goes off, no comm Haven't been able to watch a single free ads in free draw Teammates waiting in lobby, all do not join at once in a match sometimes. This version is so full of bugs.wish you would roll an update asap addressing all issues. I use OnePlus5 fyi.",2
"bad optimisation The game is Worst been, Worst  graphics, sound and the game contains many glitches andphysiques, but the Season 7 update is really buggy, I find it hard sending requests , laggy gameplay in the Battle Royale mode, periodolic freezing in multiplayer mode. My experience has been very troublesome I get killed alot of times, and the game disconnects when I have poor internet connection. The bugs started since the Season 7 update on 12th June",2
Hate  d the game very much. But after the recent season update the game has gone bad. Now takes more than a minute to get started with a match !! Still goes waiting after 60s most of times. Started getting connection issues more frequently when you are able to kill someone in game and u end up getting killed. Some times in your gameplay you have moved out from that spot but you get killed and the video recap shows u the enemy seeing u in a place beforehand and u had got shot dead.. frustrating,2
"The game keeps crashing every time I join a match, independant of the mode. I play in a LG G3 and the game contains many glitches andas said, it crashes whenever I join a match, so could you fix this as soon as possible, because I think this is a  worst  game and I would hate   to keep playing.",2
 worst  game but there is a major issue when using the basic controls with autofire: any enemy that is laying in the ground you cant shoot! You can literally camp out laying on the ground and the only way to kill them is with a grenade or knife. Please fix this!,2
Season 7 is a disappointment!! I experience so much issues of the connection etc.. the graphics is nice as usually.. I am big fan of the game and the game contains many glitches andnow this update ruin everything.. hopefully you will fix this mess so people can enjoy the game once again.. and please add more players in royal classic add like 50 or 100 more due to extension of the map we hardly play in the game and it sucks!!,2
"This is the  worst est game I ever played, I hate   the way runs, I hate   the maps, the guns, the score streaks but I had to change it from 5 star to 2 star because the br mode just keeps kicking me off this isn't the first time it has happened so please fix the game & please bring back zombies",2
"Not quite worth it!since last update Jun 11, 2020. Lags a lot and poor graphics  and bad performance They still have not fixed alot of the bugs. They many fixed 5/16 of the bugs. The keep adding weapon skins and maps, but it does no poor if Activision doesn't fix all the bugs. They are only concern about money and profits Lots of glitches",2
"The game was very poor before the new update and the game contains many glitches andI experienced some lagging ness but it was okay but the new update doesn't let me use mic and I hate   using mic because I liked interacting with people with mic instead of chatting but now it's a horrible update, plz fix this if not then I'm installing the game not only for that it's because of people being dirty and the game crashes a horrible towards girls",2
"I would have rated this game a 10/10, if it weren't for the lack of controller support on not the technical and the game crashes a lot options side of the game, like Sensitivity, ADS, etc. I'm talking about the Matchmaking side of the game, mainly Ranked Matches. I have been playing this game with my controller for a long time, but ever since I reached Pro Rank, I could not find any matches at all. It may be due to the fact that not many people play with Controllers around my area, and the developers need to fix this.",2
Game is awesome but due to too many skins of guns n other equipment the games lags a lot. When I play ranked match it's too hard to complete a rank especially when ur rank is high. When u win a ranked match u get like 33 to 37 points only. I think we shld get at least 75 if we get MVP. -ridge_5107 (My username),2
Absolutely hate   the game but since changing phones from a ZTE blade Xmax to a ZTE Zmax pro which yes I understand that is a downgrade and in return problems should be expected but despite that the device is still compatible with the application according to the play store but for some reason every time I open the app it loads up to the login menu then automatically closes and seeing how I'm supposed to be competing in the second stage of the world championship starting soon I'm hoping for help bad optimisation,2
"It was pretty poor before the update ..... No lagging...but now game lagging 2 much...moreover I am not been able to see any ad in the lucky bord section and the game crashes a lot every time it is saying that"""" you have watched all your Intel briefings for today"""" I have raised a complain for the same but still no one reverted .... Expecting a better service and quick resolution.",2
"I have been playing COD for a while now It was working fine till yesterday evening, before it updated automatically overnight ( which I didn't want or need)... And ever since the game has been crashing repeatedly & won't let me play in peace!!!! What kind of stupid update is that, huh??????????? P.S. I use a poco F1(6 gb/128 gb) running miui 11 based on Android 10.",2
"Poor game until season 7. I'm a BR player. Trying to figure out what is the prayers needs to be recited before I can find a Ak47 or M4. If you normally use any of those weapons, then you will startand the game crashes a lot and end the game searching! Got an Ak47 once in about 12 games. Spent almost the entire game trying to find weapons. Cod went from my fav to my most hated for this reason.",2
"I'm giving it 2☆ BC ------> Everytime I play RANKED MATCHES my screen always seems to lag a few sec. behind my character, especially when I go to turn corners or around buildings... By the time my screen catches up w/my guy, the enemy has already seen meand the game crashes a lot and I'm dead b4 I see them and/or get the chance to react.. Also I keep getting paired w/players that are between 20-50Lvl below me & they dont do anything but camp or run around.. PLS DO AN UPDATE & FIX THIS & I'LL GLADLY GIVE THIS APP 5☆!!!",2
"The new season is ok but. You really need to start fixing you're servers,100% of the time I'm dying behind walls the server tick rate is so bad I constantly dye to people who are running around corners-and the game crashes a lot and killing me instantly while on my screen I only see then for half a second. Also people with horrible wifi have a huge advantage in this game, all they do is run around rubber banding around the map making them impossible to hit but they can perfectly kill you with zero issues, plz fix. Lots of glitches",2
New update adds glitch where you have to restartand the game crashes a lot and it won't let you click continue . Br glitch continues. Horrible glitch in battle royale. Game just stays repeating 2 framesand the game crashes a lot and crashes. Makes me restart the game to see if I get luckyand the game crashes a lot and reconnect. Most of the times to find out I'm dead bad optimisation,2
It was the best and the game crashes a lot and one of my favorite games before update but it has been Worst  now. *Takes too much time to open (I use oneplus 6T with 8 gb ram) *Connection loose automatically every min and the game crashes a lot and takes huge amount of time to connect back (i use fiber wifi so it's stable internet) *Takes time even to change or manipulate the loadout. Please check on these issues and try to solve it ASAP.,2
"The game it's self is  worst  but there's too many aim bot users/wall hackers. No matter how poor you are.. you could unload an entire mag at point blank range to the face of your opponent and they'll never die. Not to mention, you get shot once in the foot and die quick. Funny how that works.",2
"I updated recently! The game is fantastic. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is bacause I want developers to fix Indian server. It's too laggy. I don't know about other countries but when it comes to India, it is too laggy. Seems like lot of inactive users are active now. And everything is tremendously lagging!",2
I'm literally sorry to say that we are experiencing a  worst  error in call of duty mobile latest version...lucky board feature is not working.. it's not just my problem...it keeps saying u hv watched ads and next will be available after midnight... what's this cz i Haven't watched any ad since I updated this game 3 days ago... Plz fix it... it's annoying..... I hate   this game. The  optimisation of game is pretty bad😭😭😭😭😭😭,2
"Season 7 update not that  worst , lagging issue still there and map too big for 100 players ,instead released new map. Important is TANK is Broken , it cannot be destroyed by AR or Sniper it's take 4 to 5 rockets to destroy the tank, many players including myself play and survive till the very end and the game crashes a lot and killed by tank at the end, either fix the Tank health like others vehicles or remove the tank, game should be based on skills.",2
After updating the game many things have improved. THE main reason I rated 2 is because before updating the game I felt no lag but after updating it as enemy comes near the game lags and the ping suddenly goes high. I have fiber Wi-Fi so it is for sure not because of Wi-Fi. Please fix it 🙄😣,2
"After Season 7 update, microphone does not seem to work. I had to exit the game, remove the mic permission from settings. After restarting the game, the mic permission prompt comes, gave the permission. It works after that but after a game, it does not work again. Please fix this. bad optimisation",2
"It was an excellent game until last update. Battle royale started lagging way too much even though ping was 25. Also, the ninja skill got an update where it shows u where u can reach using it and where u can't. This is a problem because if u tap on the wrong location it takes time for you to be able to use it again",2
"Game was amazing up until the latest update. My ping lowered which is  worst , but the game hiccups like 10 times in one game, especially in rank. It's very frustrating and the game crashes a lot and causes me to die a lot. I use a Samsung Galaxy S8+ and have never had a big issue until now Lots of glitches",2
I was logged out of my account and the recovery email was never sent to me even though it said it was. I went to support and they didn't help me at all. Just gave me a auto reply to my support email. There is nothing on their support website either. I'm still locked out of my account and can't do a password recovery. If there is anyone who can help me please do I really enjoy this game bad optimisation,2
"To many hackers or so called Pro players which have an amazing accuracy and the game crashes a lot and jumps and slide like a monkey. If that's not enough is nearly impossible to participate in the second stage of the tournament as its very hard to find a team to join, If you ask WHY ???? well that's because there are to many "" PRO PLAYERS "" who qualified for the second stage and of course they don't want to further compete otherwise COD Mobile administration will discover them.",2
"it is glitching, I can't watch the ads to get a token, it says I've watched a ad today but I have not and it has been saying that for 2 days in a row. And there's to much hackers, Why won't you guys fix it. And you guys are purposely targeting me. Lags a lot and poor graphics  and bad performance",2
Game crashes during ranked match after the latest update and there is no option to connect back to the match. After that cod give a penalty of deducting 50 points and ban for 1 hour for no fault of ours. Please fix asap. Besides this the game and the game crashes a lot and graphics are awesome. Will increase the stars once this issue gets fixed.,2
I hate   playing this game but the only problems right now is the game freezes up loose all volume and the game crashes a lot and the game goes totally black to where you can't see anything but you can hear. Hopefully you will be able to fix this problem because alot of players get frustrated when they are playing and this happens Lots of glitches,2
"Mic integration is downright pathetic. Such a shame that a poor game like this has an silly Achilles point. The whole point of playing multiplayer is to talk and co-ordinate with team mates. With the latest update (06_12_2020, Rank S5) half the players can't hear!!",2
"Well, the game started off as poor. But, as the game is badly optimised started rolling, it has been degrading. For instance, the FPP mode in BR hangs a lot, the screen goes dark midway forcing you to force close the app. Even after updating to season 7, it stopped opening. Had to uninstall and reinstall.",2
Before i updated to the lastest version of this game my mic was working fine all this time. Only after i have updated my game my mics occasionally stops working whilst i am talking to my teammates which is a bummer due to the fact that this game is supposed to let us interact with our friends. Plz fix this issue immediately .,2
"It's a poor engine for multi pvp . It's not so poor if you are on android 10 as it black screens for those players. Based on experience, ranked matches become a pain in the.... to try and join. So forget the world championships! Don't take this game seriously and pease don't spend money on a broken game!",2
I hate the fact that if you have a ranked match they should put you with you rank no with other if your elite 1 dont pair me up with rookies 4 and 5 comon like comon sense if im elite 1 put me with elite 1 only no higher no lower and fix the mic problem it keeps turning off after each match i like the game but if it continues like this no control over the mic n putting people in other ranks that there not equal as one then ill move to another game.....,2
From session 7 update game is became very bad to play. The game is very much lagging and is hanging the mobile. The controller are not working after working at elite rank..it became more automatically changing the aim and running direction.... So 2 star rating for this new update...,2
What the heck is going on the the glitching and lagging??? This game was  worst  and smooth game play last season. It was awesome. Now all i get is constant lag. You have to fix this please and I'll give a five star rating.,2
URGENT IMPROVEMENT NEEDED: Fix the team communication: sometimes only one person can hear and the other can't and sometimes neither one can hear anybody (This is valid for MP and BR matches). Improve anti-cheat system (this should be a PRIORITY. COD Mobile is literally filled with cheats and hacks). Fix the game balancing system: Ranked matches (TDM for example) shouldn't end 50 x 5 or close to that. Fix game sounds (it's not right to hear someone's scream close when they are far away).,2
"Awesome game but BIG issues on the IPad. I enjoy playing call of duty mobile. I usually have been playing on my iPad, however since season 7 has been updated, I have had nothing but login problems since I have had the game. Really frustrating!!! Lags a lot and poor graphics  and bad performance",2
It's a fabulous game.. mind-blowing graphics...but after the new update it's bad but why ur firm is not correcting the old errors... whenever u got hit by a vehicle u would be jumping for 20 secs ... it's happening for so long..and manier times I start a multiplayer match and end up in middle of another...these things getting everyone irritated.. Lots of glitches,2
"Very bad. Update: I can not join a match at all currently due to ""unstable connection"". I have never had this issue before, I'm fact things have been so bad I purchased the pass and now I can not play.",2
"I very much enjoy this game, but everytime I update this nd it gets done, an error comes up says google play unable to complete the download nd then I had to uninstall it. Why cant u guys fix this once for all.. I spent time to reachup my levels bt this s*** makes me to start all over again... I am serusly not liking this.",2
Audio completely stops as soon as I plug in my headphones... There's nothing wrong with the headphones as they work with other applications... It's just as soon as I plug in and start playing call of duty mobile there's no audio output,2
"REVIEWS ON RECENT UPDATE 2020 1. CHAT window lag a lot, need optimization 2. So much annoying when REQUIRED MIC MESSAGE APPEAR, whosoever is behind this change doesn't have bad logic. Can't we turn on/off mics later?! 3. Teamup with HIGHER LEVEL SETTING is not working at all 4. Too much COLORFUL especially yellow 5. Still getting matched with rookie players 6. Last but most annoying, it's bad that teamup window is separated from chat but now we can't see player's RANK and it's so tiny. Lots of glitches",2
"Hello,me Devendra I am facing a lot of server issues despite of having a tower at a range of 850 meters Just cuz of server error I have to lose 70% games in OVERALL NO. OF GAMES Please if you can help me to provide a patch which can help everyone like me then I will be a lot praised from you Then also your game is a lot better than every Shooter Game in the world",2
The game freezes when in intense fights many times...and also the game play is sometimes get irritating the ping is always bad but the game stucks at many moment...sometimes the enemy kills me even when I am not in his target...sometimes even when hitting a lot of bullets to the enemy he never dies and my hp is 150 percent he kills me in just few bullets...and the sound server isn't working properly and many times not at all working...and this issues has been from season 1 and still on..,2
Honestly it's a  worst  game but the fact it literally showed me a deal for 890 coins for a pass and after buying it went up to regular price I'm pissed off. I was forced to buy two more little packages of coins just to get the pass. bad optimisation,2
"After the latest update, there is a huge problem in voice communication. Most of the time teammates were unable to chat over voice while in the lobby and in the game. Need this fix on priority.",2
The audio on voice chat is really bad and the voice chat function is pretty broken. Pressing the voice chat button causes some weird delay and disconnects a lot. Also there is no Zombies but strangely the load out options for zombies. Please add zombies again!,2
Hate   the game i do recomend but now thinking of it when i do play battle rayal my phone screen will turn black and then i would have to restart it and then when im playing on motiplayer it will lag really hard to the point that i have to stop and its not my phone cause i have full bars and lte is working fine bad optimisation Lots of glitches,2
"honestly just after the update I was very disappointed with BR, and MP, MP just downgraded, the old version was better and WAY more enjoyable, as well as BR, my screen blacks out, it lags, it takes longer to shoot, and etc. Lags a lot and poor graphics  and bad performance ",2
"Problems in voice chat, there is an echo when more than two players in a squad play in br, also In multiplayer most of the time can't hear our friends voice, it's really annoying, this problem has started since the may update.",2
It really sucks after the update......total lag...... can't even play one match with full satisfaction.....its not bad.......its not enough if you give such a huge 2gb update.......you guys must take care of these things tooo......if there is server problem how can i manage to enter the game...... though using a high speed network connection I'm facing this problem.....do something,2
"Y'all gotta fix the whole game, when someone shoots I lag like crazy and don't even have enough time to shoot back I have bad wifi connection so that's not the problem and y'all needa find a way to get rid of hackers quick there's a lot of aim bot and wall hacks even shows on the kill cams.",2
"Switched my review from 5 stars to 2 stars after #1 spending 20$ on a single repetitious crate draw and didnt get jack s***, and #2 there is ALOT of lagging lately. On WIFI and on a galaxy s11. Wich tells me is likely a lod issue. Please fix guys and I'll update my review:) bad optimisation",2
"Last update is a mess, microphone not working; sometimes it just dont let you fire to your enemy but he does hurt you; shots not making damage and so on, FIX THIS ASAP or make you a favor and go back to previous version.",2
"The most Worst  update ever... Not able to hear the team mates voices, unnecessary voices of killing and please set the default list to friends only or give us the permission to set it! The background music is so numb and dull, didn't expected that! bad optimisation",2
Awesome game would be a 5-star if they can fix the communication problem.. it is very frustrating that the sound is intermittent.. one moment all players can hear eachother the next all communication or portion thereof is lost.. bad optimisation,2
Do to have new characters u need to pay and for the weapons u might have to spend more than usual like godawm I'm buying video game weapons not realife ;( other thing battle royale lag please fix this I also had some Lags during the last tournament could of unlock much more but when ur screen turns black out on u or freezes what could u do only bad  worst  thing that's better than Pubg & free fire that u could win matches with out buying guns on the other hand the crates put u 4 every time always,2
"If I have unstable internet connection ok but if my net was working (fine)then why did the game/server not include me in the match And why are you deducting 50,60 xp from my rank I was pro 4 and because of this I'm in ranked protection it's too much strict , I can't grind rank properly now in MP and BR And I have to test in A.i matches if the game is not lagging and when I moved to rank then sometimes it starts lagging. Last season the rank xp deduction was like 25 or 30 xp A ->Plz fix this.",2
"I hate   this game, I've been playing it for a long time now...I'm using a samsung Galaxy s8 and since the update came out my game has been auto closing. Done everything i can to fix it...but no, is there something else i can do bad optimisation",2
"Bad Gamplay nice and smooth but I should still be able to choose higher graphics then low, esspecially when my phone an LG REBEL 4 has an amazing display, can you pretty please fix that? Even if it will slow down performance its better then no choice at all.",2
"Please don't update, new update is really bad. Especially the Tunisia map so big for cod kinda game. Seasonal is removed i don't know how to achieve cordite now. One vs one, two showdown etc are all removed. I think this update would bring down no. Of playing users.",2
"The game joins me in between multiplayer games where others have already proceeded in their score, even of tried you loose in them, this is a glitch in design.",2
The multiplayer is okay but when i linked my Activision account i didn't have any of my cod points bad optimisation,2
I would rate 5 star but I have a  worst  internet connection but it says I don't please fix the game It won't let me play,2
Whenever i turn the game on...a music starts playing. Its not the theme music and its so loud that nothing else can be heard!!! What is going on in COD,2
Movement joystick stuck in the middle of the game. So frustrating,2
 bad optimisation It is not working when i m taking it from share it why,2
OOOOHHHH NOT BAD bad optimisation,2
Bullets dont register I shoot the enemy over 20 times to kill him and the lagg is horrible ppl with alot of glitches this update but the Worst  is dysinc and bullet registration,2
"It's a very bad game but on season 5 when I update the game I lost 2,000 COD points and to the day of today I still haven't gotten my points back there customer service sucks ass honestly.",2

The new update sUcKs it way to big The graphics are not good,2
I am facing alot of issues with my mic... Not able to hear anything while Playing with my partners ... please fix this issue as soon as possible,2
Changing my rating after Update game has some kind of audio glitch with one plus devices. When I turn on microphone option game audio becomes inaudible.,2
Ok so from a five star rating I'm gonna give a two star now after many issues in the game it is not that fun like before the tank system dropping from master 4 to elite 1 was just horrible. Before me and my friends used to match up daily for more than 3 to 4 hours and now not even for an hour,2
"On this new update my phone (Redmi note 8 pro) Keeps on crashing when loading, while in the menu and while in a match. THIS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE THIS UPDATE. GAME WAS ALWAYS FLUID AND STABLE RUNNING AT MAX GRAPHICS. Hope you can fix this ASAP because I purchased the new season pass and I cant even play.",2
"😞changing my review cause in latest season thers is major glitch in the AUDIO ,there's a certain annoying music in the background that you cannot shut no matter what, music continues in the match also. I have cleared cache and data, even reinstalled the game, restarted my phone and everything but it goes temporarily then comes back again. I'm so done with this, I'm actually deleteing the game with a heavy heart also the support team never responds, i emailed them and still no reply bad optimisation",2
Never use this app cause its made by Having bad optimisation and bad graphics,2
It was bad but dipointing that there is no zombies Lots of glitches,2
Hey developers I had an account with facebook and now its logged me off and saying that my acoount is linked to another device when it shouldn't be any advice? Please respond asap thanks and plus I had this game since it the first beta as well bad optimisation and mic issue ,2
"The ability to use wireless controllers is a bunch of b.s. It gives others an advantage, defeats the purpose of bieng a ""mobile game"", and seems it allows players to kill with 1 bullet, when I unload a full clip and they dont die. W.T.H? It's fun, but not when you play against a bunch of controller players and get annihilated.",2
 worst  game just to much players cheating lagging around game to stop others from killing them using controllers to play when it touch screen and the one I hate the most is people using aim programs to aim why they hold the fire button bad optimisation and mic issue,2
"After i updated it recently im unable to join any kind of matches like br mp n ranked matches. It shows reconnecting to game, failed to join match. I changed my wifi network, still it shows the same. I uninstalled it and installed it again but it doesn’t work. Infact my exp is being deducted continuously. Figure out the problem n let me know",2
"The game has a lot of issues that needs to be handled including the voice disconnection during team play in BR. Other than that, I am facing a problem in S7 where the lucky draw videos won't work.Every time I try to open it shows ""You have watched all the intel briefings for today”. bad optimisation and mic issue",2
"Controller support stopped working after I updated to Android 11 Beta. My phone is already paired to my wireless controller, but when I try to connect it in the controller settings, it's not doing anything. Will rate higher when it gets fixed. bad optimisation and mic issue",2
"Went from a 5 start to a two, why? Well it won't load. And my wifi and data are fineee bad optimisation and mic issue",2

I run for 1 second then it teleports me back a second that happens atleast 1-3 times every game! I hear cod music and some other random music that loud that I can barely hear anything while in matches so I go off the app I still hear it then I close the app and it stops so I mess around with audio settings in cod does nothing so I closed the app again watched yt for about 2 hours then came back on cod and it was fine!?,2
UGHHH.. ever since the update there is a HUGE lag and it's driving me up the wall almost to the point I don't wanna play anymore and that'll be the case if this isn't fixed soon.. not worth the space in my phone if it continues which is sad because I actually hate   this game. PLEASE FIX ... LIKE NOW.,2
"Totally stupid that you won't update the game due to ""the current situation "" ..... what has that got to do with a game update? Now the free movies don't work?",2

"Since the last update ... There had been few glitches.... Specially with the Mike and speaker. And it's lagging a bit... Please fix it. Have to restart or reload the again again and again .... Due to Mike and speaker issues, they don't work",2
Too many Bugs from this Season . Too many glitches. Leaving any vehicle results is sky diving and gets killed too by any random person. U could have earned 5 out of 5. But I lost too many games because of these bugs.😡. I am not happy with your performance this time. I have been playing the game since it was released and a premium player too.😡,2
Needs better and smoother graphics tho. Lots of glitches,2
"Con la Nueva Actualización, tengo autenticar todo el tiempo, verificando y esta nueva opción no tiene señal. Y algunas otras dificultades. Cuando se lanzó el Gamer versión beta, funcionaba mucho mejor. P. D. No puedo tener todo el tiempo abierto la cuenta con la que ingresó al juego, en mi caso es la del Face y verificar. No se donde radica el problema, pero es bastante molesto. Espro mejores actualización..",2
"Ever since the new update , the game just lags , glitches , prior to the update everything was ok ,never had problems till new installment ,",2
Stop updating this app every month!!!!!!!!!! The game is very bad Lots of glitches,2

"The update didn't make any sense, two shots and you're dead!! Not even time to move",2
I hate tdm on ranked it is so annoying and that is the only reason i quit playing ranked,2
The game is awesome but ....don't you think that 2.5 gb is too high?? The game is very bad,2
Two months in gameplays nice graphics nice but of course call of duty is made by a money hungry company the ranked mode is unplayable if u don't spend money sure people will swear with their lives that this game isn't pay to win it's either they haven't played ranked mode for long or they pay to play u get perks like 10 seconds speed boost in battle royal and ranked mode which is unattainable by free players 🙄 go ahead download spend ur time and when u realize it is pay to win u will remember,2
 The game is very bad  New missions and maps please,2
Hate   this game but since last season its really glitching a lot and a lot of bugs Turns off connection a lot Fix bugs and will give again 5 stars And now I can't even download it It's keeps crashing,2
After the update the game crash! bad optimisation and mic issue,2
Why does the hard point not reflect the number of kills added up between team? And sometimes when I look at the replay I'm not even hit when I die...,2
"They should really make this game a bit better,they changed so much stuff it sucks ass now",2
"Empeoró el juego, falla muy seguido al jugar. Falla la conexión por voz, esto teniendo bien el internet; nos saca del juego de repente; y, tiene más lag. No se juega a gusto.",2
Still lots of bugs like people shooting through walls and trip mines not going off bad optimisation and mic issue,2
With the newest update my game now crashes and freezes 2-7 times a day. also game de-sinc is at an all time high. so this means that most of the time I can't play properly. It's sad when I'm forced to take penalties because of this. This is the first time I've had the problems since I got the game her it was released in Canada in late July last year. And don't mention how many times I've been screwed in ranked by the voice channel's crashes. Went from being  worst  to atrocious in 1 update.,2
 The game is very bad I'm pissed off right now poor gameplay  and poor graphics,2
"Hello, there is a little problem. When i first started playing the game it was totally fine. Then today i logged in then after 10 seconds music started playing. Not the normal Call Of Duty music. The music was loud and i tried to go into settings and then turn off the sound, the music would not go away, and it keeps happening. Please fix this glitch/bug. Thank you.",2
"I hate   the game, but the mic problems are horrendous and practically every game on battle royale the game kicks me out and shuts down. This game has been taken over by pay to play. The more money you spend the more chance you have at winning. A really bad game that requires a LOT of attention. Also bring back zombies",2
"Once you rank up around level 110 or 120, its pretty much pay to win. People move at absurd rates and can kill you with 2 bullets while you unload an entire clip, even If you both have the same gun with attachments. Either that, or people are cheating. Game gets worse with every update and they're absolutely enormous. Game functions and looks fabulous, just not fun anyone due to this. Waste of storage as far as I'm concerned.",2
"The game is  worst  and that, but my phone just won't let me update the game. Please make the files smaller!",2
In this new update voice chat isn't working and there is too many glitches a sound just played in my game and it's not turning off i can call it worst update but i play the game in a low ping it is bad thing,2
The game will not load since the update bad optimisation and mic issue The game is very bad,2
Mics don't work most times in teams😔 Lags a lot and poor graphics  and bad performance  bad optimisation and mic issue,2
This is really getting stupid! How can you play when all it does freeze up! Just cancel this update and start over.,2
Could you please give better graphics to the huawei p30 lite its capable of higher graphics then  low Lots of glitches,2
"I've been playing this game for a fair few months now, and, at first, I liked it, even to the extent where I paid money for the battle pass (something I rarely do on any mobile game). Unfortunately, since the most recent update, I've not played a single game where I haven't experienced frequent connection issues, and in most cases, got my game time cut short by being killed while waiting to reconnect to the game, and the more this happens, the more tempting that ""uninstall"" button becomes.",2
Fix the goddamn matchmaking system of your game. Stop putting master 3 players against master 5 and legendary players. bad optimisation and mic issue,2
"It gets to 4% and then says there's an error. I have enough storage and the wifi is bad, but it hasn't been letting me install it for a while.",2
Matchmaking is not fair. Gameplay is bad but who spends more money gets an unfair advantage 😞 Lots of glitches,2
I hate   the game but some glitches are so annoying like mic problem and all.. Fix it. The game is very bad,2
it got lots of problem in audio while playing BR or MP in season 7.Lags a lot and poor graphics  and bad performance,2
The game keeps crashing on my Samsung A30 even after I updated to android 10 ... what do I do ... it's frustrating not to be able to play because the game keeps crashing ....,2
It takes too long to download and you have to deleat all you'er apps its abad game thoghe...👿👿👿👿👿😡😡😡😡😡😡😉😉😉😉😉😉😤😁,2
"Everything is bad on this game, but the unfair gameplay and the ability to use an external controller is not right to the ones who are on a phone or tablet. Isn't that the point of this being a mobile game?",2
"I hate   the game but the background music is too loud and still plays during game play, I tried muted it but won't work, please fix. Lots of glitches",2
It's fun and really useful for when I'm bored but it keeps crashing and lagging way to much and now it's just getting so bad that I can barely play a single round with bad gameplay and now I can't even shoot or aim fast without much lag I'm having they still need to work on the lag and all I go up against are hackers they need to fix that,2
The game is very lagging after d update Lags a lot and poor graphics  and bad performance ,2
Nice controls but lags out horribly sometimes especially on certain games modes. The game has nothing but bots so if u think ur playing against other people ur not it's just AI. But overall the game is ok,2
"Get rid of Skill based matchmaking in normal multiplayer please, it really ruins the fun. The game is very bad Lots of glitches",2
My meaning is not to say that the is not a fantastic game but it's grafix is low that's why I have given 2 Stars,2
 Lots of glitches Lags a lot and poor graphics  and bad performance ,2
This game is marvelous and the best poor game of shooting. But sometimes it lags that will irritates you and it's big the game is badly optimised come very fast and i personally liked its 3 version it also had zombie mode but time changes everytime.,2
After the update I am not able to update my game it get stuck at 59% and I tried re installing it and boom I can't install the game also Please help.....,2
All over bad but update is too much big..some time bigger then main game... Sometime lag due to large data.. Need to develop seperate game for bettle royal and multiplayer game.,2
"Lags a lot and poor graphics  and bad performance. The new update is taking more than 2 gb space and I don't have that much space on my tablet. Please help me, what to do. Lots of glitches",2
"😠😠🙏🙏There is a huge network bug right now even when I'm using a fast internet its slows down very much, i sometimes even get upto 212 pings. Please please fix it. Apart from this, this is the  worst est game I have ever played in my mobile, literally the best game you can get on your mobile devices. Thank you Activision for making this game. Call of Duty have always been near and dear to my heart and getting it on mobile is the dream come true for me. Thank you.",3
"Re-writing the review as the game has improved extremely well. I've been a regular player since season 1 & love  d every thing the game has put out for the players. But the one & only problem I have been facing is the game audio , especially in BR. Sometimes you hear random screams of players dying who are nowhere around you , & at other times you won't hear a single sound of an enemy which is right next to you or behind you. Other than that , the Best Mobile Game Out There In My Opinion !",3
There's a glitch in the game that doesn't allow me to maybe move forward or anything in certain times of the game. I would even clear the cache and unnecessary data on the app however it still would have the glitch. It's so bad it definitely costs me a lot of my games. If not for that if give a 5 star. But it's so bad it makes a person consider going to PupG.,3
"worst  game, graphics and lots of game modes. But VTOL and Goliath are overpowered as hell. I think reducing their duration and adding limited ammo to them will balance them. Also, there are always people who left the match in ranked mode that's why I lost most of my matches. Plus why won't you add real players to the game instead of bots? Some of em have the same name and easy to recognize. Because they only get 1-2 kills in the whole match. This is terrible",3
"This has got me hooked! Update 1: the season 7 update shows that they listen to the users! The practice map was much needed and here it is now. Waiting for the new BR maps. There are few issues though. Main problem is that the game just force closes randomly, even while simply navigating through the menus. Probably something that could be fixed in a later update. Update 2: Force closes twice in the same multiplayer match now. Ratings go downy!",3
"I am sharing my experience with call of duty mobile. I don't like the fact that people will shoot at me and the bullets will be close to me and I die. You should only die when the bullets hit you. I also do not like the fact that the battle royale glitches out and it will make me die. Also if you could add more maps to frontline. I hope you recieve my review, thank you.",3
"The game is just awesome, the consistent upgrades, the continuous seasons.... It's  worst ! I had a problem signing in for the last few days with the whole ""Authorisation Error"" stuff but I managed to resolve it after crying to Support about it. If this game needs any improvement, it'll have to be the support department of it. Too many unresolved issues and without any answers. Solve that bad optimisation and mic issue",3
"This game is awesome. I love   the graphics, I love   how smooth it is, I love   the game modes, but I don't like the lag. Even if I have  worst  internet connection, I start lagging out of no where. Also, I don't like the way how you get to use a controller. It gives less advantages to the people who aren't using one, which is pretty unfair. 1v1 is bad, but like I said, you get to use a controller. The other guy gets more of an advantage by using a controller. This is why I gave this game 3 stars.",3
"worst  and the most wonderful fulfilling game that I have played in a longtime, but after playing for a while it's start to freeze up a lot,blank out and jump off the game,recently I have reach level 20 and the game just crash and I lose my entire profile and have to be installing it back and start all over again, I would give it the 5 stars but these problems need fixing first,this new update is rubbish,it doesn't deserve a five start,first you guys make us have to start over all again",3
"It might be the best first person shooter. The transitions and controls are smooth. The graphics and movement is also bad. But the game is also full of glitches, crashes, and network errors. Please improve these problems in the the game is badly optimised. Edit: just sell your game to Tencent if you can't handle the servers. Bloody network drops by 1 point, and the game starts reconnecting. bad optimisation and mic issue",3
"I'm currently facing issues with Season 7 update, ping issue (Sudden rise in ping on a stable internet connection, and I have tired on multiple connections as well) and delayed resignation of shots in BR, sometimes I'm not able to see my own operator or any others, I have to restart the whole app during the BR match. And one of my friends has also informed me of same bug and issue. I hope this gets fixed soon.",3
"Worst update ever. There are cheaters abroad throughout this already glitchy game. Especially seeing thru walls. Kick these people out only to have them return. And aim-bot is just pathetic. Man up get down or lay down. Sniper rifles might as well be lightsabers. Overpowered power overly. Everybody's a sniper now? Rank bums. Stop mixing the poor with the wack. However you can't knock the maps. Too much animation. But most characters, guns, passes, etc... are awesome. It's still a doable game yo.",3
I would have given this app a 10 star if not for the consequent lagging. Sometimes I feel like slmming my phone on the floor. Even in the season 7 update they didnt even fix the lagging issues. I live this game. This us the only game I can sit down and play since in my life but it needs to fix lagging i love it my character will be moving back if I'm going forward. COD mobile if u fix this I will give it a 5 star. Thank u,3
"This is really poor game interms of graphics and game modes and everything... But after the last two major update..Game is filled with bugs... most important one is Not able to hear other friend during match or pre match and in various modes ,suddenly u wil be left alone and u cant see anyone else... i can just keep on saying about the bugs.. unless u clear the bugs ,in very soon time ...everyone will stop playing this game for sure...",3
"Poor afternoon, playing your game. Until the last update, everything was fine, but after the last update, the game started to close for no reason, it can close while I'm in the game menu, or already in battle, but steadily without any warnings closes. Played on the oneplus 5t android 9 smartphone, thank you in advance! bad optimisation and mic issue",3
"I gave those three stars right now get so awesome game I love   you I'm very addicted to it I even played the original in completed the whole game now let's get you why I gave 3 stars here, 1) When moving through boards glitch and you end up in a different area or somebody's coming after you and it will glitch and then they end up shooting you because you're not able to grab your gun at all because the screen freezes, 3.) soon as I start a new game I'm already dead and have to wait to respawn.",3
"I been facing problems since last week. Overall the game is good, but it keeps disconnecting!! My player wont pickup loot , enemies & teammates keep dissappearing as a glitch!! Tried clearing my cache bt dsnt solves the problem & I hv to restart game to get back to normal. This ruined my gaming experience since last week. Please solve the problem!!!",3
It's an awesome game with very . The  game is having good graphics and gameplay is awesomegraphics. I also felt it better than pugb mobile. The only problem that I found now is that the voice chat doesn't work properly. Sometimes I am not able to hear my friends or they can't hear me. So plz fix that. The new update is so glitched that when ever I play hardpoint rust all the enemies spawn behind me and they keep on killing me. So fix that plz otherwise it will be so annoying to play this game.,3
"They fixed the smoke grenades, the amount of credit store items, and it doesn't kick me out of the game anymore. However, there's still the issue that every time that we get a camo, it's a completely different gun unlike the settings for the BR guns. It would be a lot better if we didn't have to spend so many xp cards on every camo. Every camo should be organized into the gun that it is. Like the BR gun settings except that we have our attachments that we've unlocked so far for the gun.",3
"It's very addictive! Great graphics, good social interactions, and the game is badly optimised features to keep interests. The only issue I've found so far would be the lagging which caused me to die a repeated amount of times in battle royale on excellent wifi. There shouldn't be that much lagging and on a regular basis. Other than this, the game is amazing.",3
"EDIT: I changed my review due to the fact that if you have a bad connection and cant connect to a ranked match, you get kicked and lose 50 rank points. Fifty? For a bad connection? I didnt even lose. This needs to change. If not, at least lower it to like 25 rank points deducted for a match that you cant connect to.",3
"This game is fun. But I'll give 3 star or lesser for the in-app purchase .... Try not to spend money trying to get new skins as the game developers would not let U get the skin U want Example: U purchase the ""360CP"" for the ""buy 10"" items. There are 17 available items there if you buy the ""360CP"" twice, U will get the other listed items except the skins. If you then buy another ""360CP"" U will get a repetitive items ""double"" without the skins. Why would U keep giving repetitive useless items😡😡",3
"There is too much stuff in the game unlike every other cod game which is simple. And i dont get why there is a battle pass because it ruins the aspect of Cod Mobile, I hope you can fix some of this and, if you add things please make it bite size additions not mega phone data stealing additions. Hope you read this review and maybe fix some of the problems.",3
"Absolutely Love   the game & play it a lot. But been having issues with killing people. Some games will work fine then the next I'll empty a clip into someone and they won't die but turn around & kill me with like 3 round & we're using the same gun. Also War Machine now suck dew to the EXTREME drop in rounds after fired, you literally have to aim really high in the air to shoot very far which is RIDICULOUS! Have been having problems with enemies being invisible as well as server lag",3
"Call of duty needs to fix a several bug like spawning in an ongoing match in multiplayer non ranked mode , it's annoying. The game's not smooth as other battle royal games , so they need to fix this issue in both battle royal and multiplayer mode. But I like playing this game because it's really likely to get rifle skins and stuff if I play frequently.",3
The game is cool but there is a lot of problem. First the hacker in Rank match are ruin the fun. When the game kick me out but never returned back the game to finish off. The rank match is broken and there is two girl skin who are cheating the game and try be a god. Please Call of Duty Mobile fix the game because I was playing Call of Duty for 10 year.,3
I was expecting to play with my cousins from the philippines. But for some reason I can't even find them through search friend. It'll say player does not exist. Or can't be found. I even checked through Facebook friends and they weren't in the friend list. The only friends I see that were from the philippines are the ones who moved to the states.,3
"I really like this game. Well done the designers. However.... Occasionally, as other reviews have reported, the screen will suddenly go black, but sound remains. I've also increasingly noticed in battle royale, enemies simply dont die, even after emptying a full mag, then they kill you with a couple of rounds. Something is definitely not right. Reduced to 3 stars for this.",3
"Runs smooth, no random crashing or freezing. Typical COD players though. ie. Spawn trapping, camping, ect. Other then that pretty good. Chews through my battery life though but I expected that..... UPDATE. Starting to be very leggy, and crashing now. New update... controls are ruined. Using a ps4 and basically unplayable now. Thanks gang.",3
I opened the app and it keeps on saying there is an error with my WiFi. I checked and I found that I had stable and usable fast WiFi I enter the game again and it just keeps saying the same thing. I then checked if there was an update but there was none. I looked on the official website and none of the fixing bugs things helped. Please help. I'll rate the game a 3 for when I played and there was no bug I was addicted to the game. Other than that please help fix this bug I have,3
"Great app. When it works. Just like the console/PC game. Can play without purchases but for premium you need to pay. When the game works you need it, when you. Ant get into it you love it. Just purchased a battle pass, unable to get into account. App. Keeps crashing with an authorization code. Activision have a long way to go. Save your money.",3
"It's amazing game but the issue is after the recent update it's lagging alot which i have never faced before😪 and the connection problem it says ""download configuration failed make sure your device is connected to the internet"" even though i have fast internet connection and i resart the game as well as my device . Please activision fix the issue with these things 🙏🙏",3
New update is awesome.. fully loaded with new equipments.. when it comes to gameplay.. loved the new battle royale map extension.. but I still have a doubts on the scoreboard in multiplayer match ( not for all match).. because the kills I take is not equal to the scoreboard.... For eg... If I kill 4 enemies the scoreboard reads as zero n continues to be zero... And all of sudden the scoreboard increase .. I don't the exact reason.. can u pls clear this doubt 🙂,3
"I would give this game a 5-star rating, however as I play I get teleported all the time. I am not sure if this is due to a server issue, but I have bought the Asus ROG 2 phone specifically for this game. I have both excellent cell reception as well as WiFi. I feel that should not ever experience teleporting (shifting, ghosting) however you want to say it during the gameplay. Please fix this and I will fix my rating. Like I said this is a top of the line gaming phone.",3
"Wouldnt hav giving 3strs cuz honestly game is great. However, i really dont know if people are enjoying this but this recent addition of a TANK in battle royal is pretty annoying in my opinion. I mean.....WHY? U can basically destroy anyone in your path and for the fact that it is placed at the very center of where the safe zone will end, means players have no choice but to come face to face with whoever is lucky enough to get it first. which ultimately defeats the purpose of a SURVIVAL mode",3
New update is too bad. You can't hear your team when you are in the game and game is lagging every now and then. The old version was better than the new one. It you need good weapons or characters you have to purchase or else you loose the match. Developers please try to fix the bug. Graphic is good but with new update few things are messed up also please avail few good weapons. I tried to purchase the new PWD weapon seems like you guys are fooling us instead I got a knife and a bomb too bad,3
"Not gonna lie. Even with the problems I play this gam religiously BUT I'm still giving 3 stars because the game drops sometimes and I lose connection. Also, in ranked matches if this happens and you end up playing a game thats 4 v 5 or wlovever uneven ratio the amount of xp lost towards your rank will still be the same. Its really unfair.",3
"Gameplay is great but there's too many micro-transactions, every season the stuff in the free season pass just keeps on getting fewer and worse, with the good stuff locked behind a paywall. Wish the zombies mode was brought back, honestly had some of the best gameplay on the mobile market and you lot scrapped it, unbelievable.",3
"The best shooter game out there, doesn't require p2w features and graphics are pretty smooth. Would definitely recommend this to anyone trying to find a game to kill time. EDIT: i changed my review to 3 stars because my game constantly keeps crashing and sudden lag is present. I won't change my review till this is fixed.",3
"From 5 stars to 3. Lag issues, and rank mode should not be deducting rank points if you are doing good while your team is doing horrible. As a solo player, one game I win and the next two I lose, what's the point or plan? To be glued to my phone all day just to rank up? Hell no. At first ranking is easy but your almost done ranking, they set you back. It's why I went back to mp matches.",3
"Ok so the game was awsome till the season 7. Like you added tanks that just can't be destroyed like the game usualy ends with a player and a tank well take a shot, who do you think wins? And the ninja on battle royal, rabs like a 1m under the point where it should so you need to grab twice to get on the building and when someone is shooting at you it's no help. Fix this, emove the tanks or slow them down and take some of max health it has down.",3
I am a big fan of this game. I also spend money for this game. I am playing on my tablet Samsung s6 but every time I play the game kik me out at least three times. It is so annoying. I still love this game. Please fix it. * After 2 update... it's better but the game still kik me out. *,3
"Fun game. But there is some bugs that need to be fixed. Like when someone goes prone, you can't shoot them? I watched one dude fly off the map with Gravity spikes and kill a person in front of me. Then run back thru the fence on Nuketown. Being shot thru walls, even though you are not up against the wall (brick and wood walls) or being shot thru a metal pole on Killhouse. Other than those annoying bugs. The game is fun.",3
Just made Pro in Rank match trying to get the new AR. For some reason it takes a while to get in game. Mic doesnt work in game. Are you all even reading these comments. Screen jumps in game. Bad focus in aiming while ADS like its rigged for one to win in 1on 1 situations. I've spent hundreds of dollars in this game. I wont spend more if these problems wont get resolve and bring these prices down so every one can experience new skins and etc.,3
"Great game to play, the graphics are good. It is a rush when you are into it. I only gave it 3star because they dont give out some of the nice items when tier goes up. You have to actually pay for it. They should make it fair enough, like half and half with the items. I dont think it's fair that you can only obtain all the cool stuff by paying. Other than that i would have giving it a 5star. M.M.A",3
"I just love this game. Great work. But the reason why i gave this game 3 stars because of the game's bug. Whenever I start a tdm/domanation/hard point, I always join the game late. I mean when I start a match I see the match has already started 2/4 minutes ago. I have a decent internet connction and my ping is alway 50-70 but I still face this problem. Please fix this as soon as possible Thank You.",3
"Pros: The limited time game modes, and the battle royale mode. I also really enjoy how you can get cool unlocks even if you don't play ranked. Tons of in game events. Cool guns and skins available. Cons: Unskipable final kill cams, No way to obtain premium currency besides by paying for season pass, load times take too long, lots of rubberbanding, and constant crashes. Game auto rotates even if I don't have auto rotate on my phone. Final Score: 3/5. Play it, but don't spend money on this game.",3
"The new season 7 update is awesome. They even added the Warzone kill (sound) effect. The only issue I faced was in the free (watch a video) lucky draw.... Everytime I try to watch a video and spin the lucky draw, it says that I have already watched the maximum amount of videos (even when I haven't watched a single one) and that I should come back the next day. CODM, please fix this..... Otherwise, the game is good.",3
"I like this game, but as a female gamer I'd expect to see some female characters without having to pay money for them! I feel the need to show off my skills as a female in a female character and not as a man. This game is proving to be sexist and I do not approve. The guns are greats a long with the awesome gun skins and the gameplay itself it pretty cool.",3
"The game keeps kicking me out!!! I have cleared the cache and restarted multiple times but certain maps/game modes crash my game, its most frustrating because when playing ranked matches the game crashes and I get banned for leaving its not fair when I cannot enter the match due to crashing. please fix! I have an LG G7 so ram and storage is not an issue",3
"Awesome game but it always crash 3 to 4 times while playing battle Royale please fix this the older season do crash but only once. To the developer please fix this I love this game I don't want to continue playing my old games but if the issue continue guess I'll have to change but your game is awesome and my phone is vivo U3X, ADRENALINE 610 GPU and SNAPDRAGON 665.... Please fix this..... Thanks",3
"It's fun. I also like It a lot . It sometimes,help me relieve the stress I have by killing people. Also I getting excited ,every time a new mode is coming out , it's actually a really enjoyable game . I dont know about what other people think but I think this app has everything good and nothing for me to rate it bad , however sometimes its annoying so I am gonna rate it this . BYE!",3
"Great game! The game on Battle Royale is lagging like crazy since the last update (where the map size increased). Also the mic issue that a lot of others have talked about. PS -For those facing the mic issue: to fix the mic issue, you need to turn it on, every single time you're playing. Not ideal, but at least it becomes manageable. Please fix. The lagging is making it especially unplayable.",3
Love the game!! But love the glitches & the screen blacking out!!! I have the graphics settings all the way on LOW!!!!!!! I have the newest Samsung S6 which I would think would be the best tablet for this game but I am VERY WRONG it stinks!!! Not sure what else I can purchase to make it better???? Would love too give 5 stars if they would fix these MAJOR PROBLEMS!!!,3
I love the game in my opinion but theres 2 problems.It takes so long to download it and whenever I play battle royale in the middle of the game the screen just turns black and I cant see anything in the game so I had to restart it and reconnect to the game which I love so pls try to fix this problem I need to download call of duty fast even though I have 128 gb so pls fix this problem:(,3
Had this game since season 1 . Theres a new update . I do not know how many people are experiencing this but all of a sudden you have to wait 200+ seconds and you cant leave the match by pressing cancel because it wont let you. Many lies were told about the update . 4/10 . Not going to uninstall only because I've spent money,3
"Altogether an okayish game. They've tried to pack too much in one map. One cannot get the hold of everything in a game. 5-6 times of hand grenades confuse which one to select plus selection itself takes more than a second. Loadout options are nice but can have better and more user friendly display on screen in-game. Concepts are very similar to PUBG as it is very much influenced by TENCENT also. Thus, it gives no appropriate reason to play COD leaving PUBG.",3
"Changes needed, 1. Need selection of modes in ranked matches. ( I love search and destroy ) 2. It's a bug sometime rc shock freeze and not going forward. 3. This season Gun skins are WORST. Even uncommon looks good against epic. 4. There should be better if reward we get when transformation from one to another layer i.e. pro to master , no random reward. 5. Playing as a single in ranked showing waiting only. 6. Microphone access is not proper in this update. Guys what have you done in this updt",3
"So, I ran into a problem and had to reinstall the app, because I had to update it, then went back into it, and had to to sign into my Activision account again but whenever I click on the call of duty icon to sign in, the game just crashes and does the same process over and over again, if it is possible can you please help me with this? Thank you.",3
I'm getting trouble while loading the game. Training round works fine but when I try to play the multiplayer mode the screen turns black. I have tried installing the game several times from play store and also Sharing through xender. I request you to provide solution to this problem. Thank you! Phone details : Samsung j6 plus Processor: sd 425 Thank you!,3
"C'mon man, nothing has been shown up, still the problem of server connection is continuing. The server is always getting unstable nowadays and rose up-to 199ms and stays there due to which the game can't be play like previously in the past seasons. So, plz in yhe next update do something about the server connectivity esp .,the new season is awesome but the server isn't stable as like always",3
It's a good fun game and all just with using the controller it works once and never works again and I've done just about everything I was wondering if yall could do something about that like one of my many problems is when I move and go to stop like stand still I'll keep running or when I'm turning I'll keep turning and there no stop to it...its been making me quite aggravated,3
"The latest version of COD is improved in graphics, controls, new maps and tasks too. But in this radio active agent version the back ground music is not good and I don't like it. The previous version Bgm is just awesome and when I get in the game the Bgm set mood to play. So please replace the new Bgm with older one.",3
The freezing of the game when 85% done with a battle Royale is heartbreaking. To loose due it this failure is rather upsetting. The normal MP never has this issue for me. This was the last update that started it. Other than this I would call it a 5 star top notch game. Fun to play.,3
"The regular multiplayer is great however the battle Royale leaves much to desire. The game crashes a lot when you play and do the simplest of things such as using your scope on a sniper,switching weapons, etc. My phone has 0 issues with performance and can play any game and not have issues. However when it comes to specifically the battle Royale on this. The battle Royale will crash multiple times per session making it impossible to play. Also the game servers such as in lobby are super laggy",3
The reason for less stars is one that Many a times it lags. Also one just can not voice chat with friends like other similar games. The voice echos and the level of echos increases with the number of players. So if there are three player the echo will be thrice. Definitely needs to resolve. Its my personal favourite game on PS & Mob but basics are definitely required for excellence.,3
"From last 3 days m unable to access COD every time m trying to open the game it's showing ( sorry there was an error during the Google play download.please make sure you are connected to a stable network and try again later.if you can't solve it , please go to the official website or community pages for help) my network is stable and can easily access other games. Can u plz help me out to fix this issue????",3
"Latest review: season 7 update is full of lag in br, can't play for 1 minute without frame drops. Game freezes most of the time in my realme x2 especially in br mode ( frame freezes and black screen issue ), android 10 Snapdragon 730g. 60 fps gameplay is laggy. I am hoping for one dedicated season for only performance improvement.",3
"Very good game with good graphics. But takes lot of memory and it does not have a lite version. When tried to update it, it was not happening and I probably have to delete it. I used to play through guest and I was at level 88, Veteran 3, and tier 80, but after I delete it, I will not be able to access my account. 😰😬😫😩😖. The  optimisation of game is pretty bad😭😭",3
"Now it has been a long time and I am editing my review. Wanted to give 5 star rating but it crashes even frequently. While playing BR, the screen black out happens. I don't know if Activision will fix it sooner or later. And I liked the kill sound from Warzone. Btw , probably the biggest fan of Call Of Duty franchise. 😍",3
"V1.0.11 everytime i come out of BR my app hangs on connecting back to the hub. To fix that issue, i must exit the app, then goto settings/app info-> Force Stop app and Clear Cache. You still need to work on connectivity issues EAGames. Add Clear Cache & Reconnect buttons inside the game options. Ask yourselves: Do you want your clients complaining more or playing more?",3
"Cool game... but there is a problem with ranked, cuz even though u play so well in ranked matches u still gotta lose rank xp when u get worthless teammates and they blow up the match but still even though u ger mvp with 25+ kills end up losing rank xp.. so that happened to me many times at the master 5 while pushing only one gane more to legendary, so it would be great uf u can fix it and like not deduct rank xp from the mvp player atleast..",3
"game, graphics and game play is very good. these the game is badly optimised are making the game way too big for my phone. i cannot keep deleting other things to make more room. so i may have to delete this game. Overall a solid game. They should let you send more than 5 gifts to friends 😠😠 latest update over 2gb Wow 😭",3
A really good game.I have been playing this game for around 2years.This was the 3rd online game which I play.It has good rating but I don't like one thing in this game that it takes more network.It's update doesn't attract more but makes boring.But a good game.Please try to improve the game.It hangs the most in battle Royale.I love the most in this game.,3
Whoa the game is amazing I most say I'm impressed i could bear with anything but not this one I notice when i had the old version i couldn't invite friends to join me i when i updated the game I notice when I'm playing it automatically goes off to main menu so i can't play anymore because like I said it automatically goes off I don't if it's because of my phone version I'm using Samsung s8,3
I love that you can't choose what mode you want on ranked and when I don't even go close or touch the trip mine and just kills me but when it happens to an foe the trip mine doesn't even kill them. The game has also gotten worse with so much lags and sometimes when something goes wrong it just logs me out the game and I lose points and I have to wait along time just to play another game.,3
"There is milliseconds of synchronisation issue in multiplayer gameplay, please fix that. Both side players should be in sync always. Example: opponent was able to see me before I was able see him, although I was looking at the same spot, from where he shot me. I don't think it's internet issue.",3
"The reason I put 3 stars, is because there are some things I didn't like in the new update, one of them the tank, it really kills the amusement of the game, I wish u could remove it, and there are some stupid glitches , hope u can fix them",3
You had a good game when it first came out but I'm a free player and now it's all pay to win just for a camo do what you done with modern warfare make them all cosmetic I came back 3 days ago and I have done well but I'm getting beat in gunfight by a m4 with flame bullets when I'm using a m4 when I shot first you really need to fix the game Scincierly- averagegamer32,3
I'm giving 3 stars because it seems everytime I put money into this game I get nothing but repeats from crates. I'm grateful I got 2 other characters other than the ones provided. I know I missed some seasons but still there should be a better ratio and chance to get stuff.,3
"After this update.my game is lagging so much.like I cant talk to my teamates even if the mic is on.i don't like the way u all changed everything like different way of tier that confuses me.and what about the people who don't have CP do buy cool stuff cuz all the cool stuff are found in only CP last update was nice but this update is trash,if this continues it may lead me to delete this game.plz fix all lags.this is why I'm giving it 3stars",3
Great game. Fluid controls. Third Person camera is kinda janky though. But overall great game. A single player mode would also be a great addition too. A gripe with the fact that when you die early in BR mode and try to leave you still get the penalised message.,3
This game very fun but sometimes stressful I'm good at it I told my brothers to danload it and they liked it they said it fun they even play it more then me in my opinion call of duty is a very fun game and you should danload it it's fun and I'm in level 39 so danload it it's fun!!!!!!!!!!!! And a little stressful and fun I.,3
Good game to play when you can play it because but it will pause and lose connection right in a middle of the game (Before you can say is it your connection. No it's not my connection because I have fiber). You would think before you roll out a game that you have all the bugs worked out but apparently you decide to roll out a game without checking to see if there's any bugs. This game pauses in the middle of the game which causes you to be killed or lose your game......VERY Upsetting.,3
Really good game but because the update it became kind of laggy but no problem still a great game . but I am now very frustrated because I cannot find any ranked matches in season 5 of ranked and I want to reach legendary . Activision please do something about it Activision please reply and tell whats up ?,3
"Great game 🎮🎮 cauee of the graphics,game play, and everything in general but 1 issue is that you have to save progress on Facebook, or the call of duty id so thats an issue cause im not old enough for Facebook and i dont know how to login or do anything on the call of duty id thing i just know how to use google play but overall its a good game just can yall add the google play id or wlovever so i can save my progress please would be 5 stars if that google play sign in was there.",3
"The game can be glitchy at times. I'll try to move forward in any mode. Mostly BR. And it will glitch me backwards, after I move forward a few feet. The ping can also be high at times. Besides that it's a great game",3
What has changed in the new update that the audio and mic are such problems. You cant hear team mates then you can then it's off then its back on. It's not consistent and wish it will go back to the way it was before the update.,3
"This is a good battle royale to play with friends and i liked the fact that upto 5 people can play in a squad, but again I would like to see a story mode in this which also would be playable with friends. Wouldn't that be just awesome?",3
"I wrote a good review and now I regret it because you game creators decided to remove all data when someone uninstalled the app and I ACCIDENTLY uninstalled the app and now I have to restart EVERYTHING I MEAN EVERTHING Kills, deaths, LEVELS, Skins, and more now I have to restart everything and I'm pretty much at the point where I want to delete the game but because I love the game so much I won't delete it please try to get my Account back because I want to play on my level104 character again .",3
"Hello, I love this game a lot ... I've been playing it since very long... Suddenly there's problem in BR maches...where there would be black screen after few minutes of the game ...even after the updater there no solution for it. Please solve it.",3
"Super sick, Galaxy S10e. Very smooth, beautiful graphics New update sucks. Map loads take forever. Basic targeting mode now has a ton of lag. And why change the gunshot sfx, and add a bunch of player whining? My character oohs and ahhs now even without getting shot. Booo.",3
Now since you guys have added new places in BR map the another thing that I would to see is that graphics getting more original that's the only thing which looks like leftover whenever I play in BR like making houses more original even though my settings are on vey high in graphics still something's looks leftover the rest of the game is FANTASTIC,3
"Overall a nice game with beautiful graphics & gameplay also.only reason for changing my review from 4 star to 3 star is after the last update,lagging & crashing problem in battle royale becomes more frequent which adversely affected the gameplay also.Plss fix this problem & make the game more enjoyable.",3
"Great game, except your rewards for winning is always weapon xp. And there are only so many weapons that you can upgrade. Ive upgraded all the weapons that i can. And have 100s of xp cards that will have no use. Add different rewards for winning.",3
Its still a good game but when ever i anything other than gunfight im game crashes an i have lost abou 1000 exp in ranked bc of this its annoying and i havnt been able to play ranked in 2 days battle royale is stills available but it crashes twice or so per game so i may die in the time it takes to restart i dont why this happens it may be my device but it suks,3
Fix the lobby voice bugs. It cuts out often and need to reopen game to connect to voice. Also there are many UI latency issues and bg music cuts out. Players won't be able to play the upcoming 2nd stage tournament if these bugs aren't fixed Haven't seen any gameplay bugs yet Overall Update is good but buggy. Fix it,3
I like the game a lot it's the best. just you should add offline mode . And add local. And offline mode will be just bots. I can't join beta I'm been trying to a lot. It wot let me download a Google play download I have good network and storage,3
Only gets 3 stars because there are still some issues with the game. Mainly a lot of lagging. Abd some connectivity problems server size issues i believe. One minute it plays great no problems. Then the next its disconnecting and skipping and lagging.,3
"I expected it to be like real COD on Pc but unfortunately I couldn't see any story line mode. I had no expectations to see a battle Royal in call of duty, it seems a copy of pubg and fortnite. But still the game runs smoothly and I get good fps.",3
Its awsome!!!!!! I think ppl who play this needs to be at least 11 to get ahold of this. I played with nobody under 10 yet. But also this game has game chat which you can enable and disable. The graphics are good. And Ima go play it have fun with it guyss!!!!!!!!!!!! But when I play battle royal it crashes and it needs to be fixed.,3
"Developers, Since the recent update of the game, ranked matchmaking is taking so long(approx. 3mins) and at times I cannot even play ranked mode because it doesn't get players to the game. Please do check on this matchmaking issue.!!!",3
"As to the new add to the game, its fabulous.. but due to some technical issues ( i hope it's ) like the sound problem for example.. this would lower my evaluation to the game. Hope that COD team can fix this problem as sooner as possible",3
I have been playing it since it was released but now with the latest update I am not happy how they have reduced the graphic quality and it seems like I am playing pubg rather than COD. The extended map and other new features are amazing but graphics have gone down considerably which is more or less taking away the complete experience of playing the game.,3
The game was running smoothly until this new season arrived after which the game has started giving me issues like freezing in midgame or in the lobby or sometimes during mode selection. Please fix this soon as i dont want to miss any progress in this season.,3
This game is fun great game but new update is horrible they should have left rust in there for a option rust was the best one yet and they also should have left kill comfermbed and capture the flag it's 3 stars for now until it gets better and the game never let me collect my cordite gun when I did the challenges for it the game used to be better but now it's worse more than ever before,3
"I'm not sure if it's only me but what is up with the ""death"" sound ?? It's too loud and ridiculous. In a fast paced game where multiple respawn is likely, the death sound becomes very annoying.",3
"Almost all of the time I play with a controller, the game lags and/or times out, even disconnecting me from my wifi. Not as bad of an issue when I'm not using a controller, but still happens. Also, why does disconnecting from a ranked match give you a penalty? Leaving is justified, but when the game blatantly tells you that you disconnected you STILL get a penalty?",3
"The game is really fantastic, except the battle royal mode, nothing in that is good no good graphics, gameplay sucks in that mode, setting are not that efficient. OTHERWISE it is really good, better than pubg in comparison with multiplayer.",3
With this recent update the game has be of the most aggravating with the constant lags where it's running smoothly until going against other players where I can have them in my scope and just glitching to my death. But I gotta admit the map update and ect are awesome !,3
"The game is alright, I just have problems with the lag issue and the amount of space this game takes up. At some points I don't think the game is worth it, cause it also lags up my phone while I'm doing other things.",3
This new version is not good.... previous version was very good.....apart from the graphics this new version is great... but the game is very bad. The place of starting point after dying the enemy is standing right behind.,3
"It's a great game and most of the time it runs smoothly, but now with the new update it lags WAY MORE than it used to, it kicks me out glitches, etc.., but other than that it's a great game🔥🔥",3
I don't really like it because If someone just hits Use in the legs 3 times you can Just die there should be that From Legs to Head the Damage Increases And Legs would be The Lowest It's more annoying that there is no way to get those Special Coins But You have to buy them I love it...I can't Even get Stuff unless I unlock I am Never able to get the Battle pass Well atleast I didn't put 2 stars but if you you fix these problems I'll have to lower it,3
Pretty fun but it is hard to get guns expect a lot of crates to give a small amount of credits that don't lead to anything good. And now they are removing zombies mode there goes most of the fun for me.,3
"After season 7 update m losing every rank match not because m noob,yeah m not that good either but still i cannot doing my best because of connection problem idk whats wrong with new the game is badly optimised how my ping suddenly drops from 60ms to 170 or 210 then its show reconnecting..its not a problem about my cellular data..every application is working like YT or IG n all accept this game..do something about it sir..this bugs rlly got my nerv please fix it asap...expecting more good from Activision 🙏🏻 🙏🏻",3
"Everything is perfect in the latest update but there is a issue in mic, unable to do in game chat. If chat while gaming is possible than there is glitch of mic during the lobby while connecting with friend or team. Please resolve the Mic issue.",3
"I like this game a lot but, would only give 3 star due to match making process. I end up abruptly in a match in the loosing side with score something like 9-20 all the time that just spoils the gameplay. Please improve it.",3
Graphics quality reduced than it used to be before season 7 update (especially in BR mode). I also noticed minor performance issues as well as some character bugs in BR such as character's head disappearing in middle of the match. Poltergeist alert was not working in my recent BR match when I was in final zone & only two enemies left. HBRa3 AR and weapon accessories should be provided in Training Mode along with other weapons. Tanks are too Over Powered. It should be getting a nerf!,3
I have to rate this game 3 stars because there are just way too many hackers. There are people with msmc who can kill yu within 3 shots from across the map in crossfire. I mean at least remove all the hackers from the game. Everything else is awesome. Only the hacker problem. Pls ban them codm.,3
"Wow. The map is way too big. Played for 15 minutes and only saw one other player. Too encouraging for ""campers"" and the gameplay gets boring after just running around freely for so long.",3
Everything is fine but most of time server crashes and you can't continue even in the middle of the match. No doubt my internet speed is 3-4mbps but again I want to mention after new update they didn't solved the server issue yet.,3
There is so many problems to downloading the additional last file of these game it's taking 8 to 9 hours still not downloading work on it. it's thing happening with me 4 time. I have used my extra 7 GB data to download it but still it's not working.,3
COD Mobile is one of the best mobile games I've ever played. I understand it's a business but the micro transactions are very greedy and they should be revamp the Draw system. That system truly takes advantage of gamers.,3
Game on the whole is good but when I first downloaded i bought a pass straight away and within an hour it expired no warning customer care unhelpful and didnt care ..... nice to know you can legally rob a customer. Be very careful when buying passes,3
I love this game but this glitch where I can't login with my cod account.. It's saying that the account registration complete and takes me to a page where it is black and blank... I hope you guys fix this bug or I can't play this game.,3
Last update was good infact that was way better than this new update. Sound gets cracked dealing with lag issue too much and most important is sound that is not good every time i have to restart the game but still no effect on sound.,3
"Changed from 4 stars to 3 stars for season 7 updates. I love the new map locations and new options. But, I personally feel there should be 2 different maps instead of having 1 huge map for the given game time.",3
Could you make it so that the game has better graphics for low end phones like 2gb ram phones because I noticed that I can't see other players various character skins during matches they all have the same custom skin showing in matches I would appreciate it if you look into this. Otherwise I would have given it a five star.,3
"I loved this game before update to this season 😒 Now game crushing randomly 🤬 I have a ASUS ROG PHONE 2 and I have never this problem before. Even I tried reinstalling, but nothing works... Need help... I will change to 5 stars if will game start to work good again",3
Was good before the new season update. Seems to be a lot more hackers/cheaters around now. Things like being stood next to someone with a shotgun and him with a rifle and they will still kill you.,3
Very good game but only multiplayer mode and battle royal very lag and freezing and by lowest graphics i cant play and sometimes player voice chat have problem and cant hear togethers voice .i gave 3 star for now and i hope fix this problem in future beacuse this game is very good game,3
"Game is good but it won't let me download the new update, it keeps on stopping and then restarting the download, this is the third time I am trying to download the new update Update: On the fourth try it finally worked",3
The game is good and interesting. But there is a problem when i drive the tank my display is not normal on that time every thing is ziczacking even in the new areas there is same problem. I need help developers...,3
"Please fix audio, it works fine in the lobby, once you get to the battle royale, it stop working and we are unable to communicate with our partners. Your help is needed.",3
Game is good but please eliminate the bots from battle royal. They are more than 50%in every match (i am in legendary league) . So please eliminate this and do a better matchmaking in battle Royal for better experience.,3
I was gonna give this game a 4 star but everytime I play a battle royal match it kicks me out and I have to pray am not dead this is really bad and it makes me not want to play the game.secondly the pass I finish it and it says to but the premium pass to get chest pls change this when I finish the pass and am still making it higher pls give like coins or something or just extend it,3
Definitely one of the best and most popular MOBILE FPS games but.....lots of bugs and tbh needs more free to play but I just updated the game and noticed they have done way better to give back to their community and thier F2P players!,3
"I'm having a problem, with the voice chat. Whenever we're in the lobby we can hear each other until we jump in game or the voice chat stops working once we come out of a match",3
"There is problem in mic when we start the game or before the game at the new version please fix it this is so bad for us we cqn not contact with each other.. so, we got killed when we try to press this saved sentences...",3
"Keep up the great work. New player avatars are hard to get. Weather effects like rainny windy snow sunny night modes, please remove weapons extra skins tons of unnecessary junk skins there dosent make any difference in game play.",3
"I just updated yesterday and the game keeps crashing in the middle of the game. Also, when im in the lobby it suddenly crashes, i already deleted cache, restarted my phone, u installed and installed and it keeps crashing.",3
"The game sound keeps fading, I can't hear the music and footsteps and the mic stops working if I tap on the mic button. Also, the tank is too powerful it has made the BR mode even worse. Phone: Tecno Camon 12 Air",3
The free lucky draw in the new update is not working. I try to watch an ad but it keeps saying that I have watched all the intel briefing even if I have not watched even a single ad. Pls resolves the issue,3
"Game does lag at moments where your coming in contact with other people, even though I have good signal it doesn't load up the game at times. Which is odd considering I can load up everything else on my phone quickly.",3
After the latest update the game has been showing some bugs with the audio. While i can turn the microphone on and off with a headphone but connected with it the game shows a error saying please check your microphone access and i have already checked that twice.,3
"Game is great, but there is always some issue. Some there is a lagg or maybe the mic doesn't work. We expect better from such a big franchise.",3
"Good game but when I updated to S7 it wont load me into the game, it does your intros but wont pass them, says ""loading"" then it dissapeared and sticks to the loading screen then proceeds to crash and say its not working.",3
Love the gameplay an maps but hate how the mic connection drops. Went from bad to worse. Literally cant hear each other now. Where's the fun is u cant talk to friends. This really needs to be fixed,3
Would given a 5 stars but you're still having a lot of in game bugs if anyone wanna play free then it's fine but don't waste your money unless you're rich cuz you're probably gonna get into some sorta bug and it'll probably ruin your mood of playing it,3
I used to say that it was the best game but with the last updates (since S3) it's been crashing a lot and it's just getting worse... hope they can fix it,3
i would give 5 stars the game now looks more optimize and minimal lag and bugs but the prblm i face with this new problem is i cannot watch advertisement which now gives u reward . plzz guide me with this problem it still shows the same ur advertisement has reached check out in midnight UTC,3
It's one of the best games in it's category. Though they must find a solution for the network issues that happens in the middle of the game where you are in the point of no return and it pisses me a lot.,3
"Game is amazing, but everytime there's a new season there's always issues with the mic, it fixes at the end of the season then new season starts and back to the same old",3
Ever since hardpoint was added to ranked mode it has been a disaster playing ranked. And the worst thing is that it comes up more than 50 percent of the games despite being one of 4 modes Just delete that thing,3
The new update messed up the voice chat. It hardly works now. Please fix this with a patch update so that we don't have to wait till next month to get a fix. Thank you.,3
"Awesome game, love it. Very addictive but the constant freezing and the random black screen is becoming super super annoying!! Would give it 5 stars if it wasn't for that.",3
I like the game very much. Im just having a little problem getting past the logging on part now that ive updated the game to season 7. I need help with this problem.,3
"I updated COD to play season 7, now keep saying ""loading time out"" even when I have good internet, because it works with YouTube, Instagram and apps with internet but with COD keep saying what I said before, please help I really love the game.",3
I like the game alot specially battle royale but it's now ruined by the stupid tanks that's literally the worst thing they could have did I spend alot of time and money on the game but if something dont change with the tanks i won't be anymore,3
"The sound quality is poor, and they added a new gun (qq9) and the sound is bugged, and we can't hear the shots. Its bad, try to fix it",3
I love this game but not being able to pick what you spend your money on is the only take back i hate about this game. Dont spend money on the crates or draws it isn't worth it if you get the same things over and over again.,3
The new update has problems The voice chat is worse than before can't hear clearly.....and the battle royal hang doing mission.... taught it was my network but I switch to wifi still dsame.... it started wen I updated it.... please work on it,3
"love the game, sometimes frustrating when I'm trying to load it then says I don't have a good network connection when I have played it countless times in the same place.",3
"Improve level system , I'm at level 150 for 5/6 month , and solve the microphone in game it's soo terible , alway get connecte and disconnecte , or have ecco in voice , the voice in game should build from first , it's awful..",3
The game is very great but their are some issues which are much needed to be addressed such voice interaction between players in battle royale and multiplayer both are very awful overall game is perfect so plz fix until then 3 stars from my side,3
"My phone crash when I play OSOK, it restart. It use to happen in Promp Hunt when that modality come out, but I installed a game runner and I could fix it, but now that's happening again and I don't know what to do :/",3
"I changed my rating from 4 star to three star. The multiplayer is still very fun, especially with weekly and featured game modes, and the battle pass season's are very fun and have exciting rewards. However, connection is an issue, mainly in battle royal where there are lots of servers in a single room. Lag will cost you the game more often than not. Hitboxes are also goofy, and can have more work done on them. Overall, it's still a very fun game.",3
After the update game is smoothly playing it's laging .. i have note 9 i was playing it on highest settings but now even on medium settings gameplay is not smooth at all .. just because of the update I'm giving it less stars otherwise it is the best game,3
Please remove the tanks in battle royale they are overpowered. Its a 1 shot with epic armor and 150hp. And it also has too much health. I try shooting the tank down and i get sniped of the tank kills me.,3
This is an amazing game But there are a few problems. First of all they force you to upgrade every update. If not they take away a lot of the features. As well as completely slowing you game down making it all impossible to play. I have a strong Wi-Fi connection and a stable line. The game can lag even that it's delayed by 5s. I think this is poor features especially by such a popular game. Maybe I don't have a spare 2Gb on my phone as this game took up the last?,3
I do have some trouble with multiplayer match. I can't play multiplayer match very often one day maximum 5 times. The loading screen count upto 150 then also the match won't start,3
"Team making is really bad. In Normal TDMs, most of the times all of my teammates are bots who don't even try to run when they are being attacked and same case for opponent team.",3
When ever I play battle Royal for a long period my game always force closes and I have contacted multiple times support and they can't be bothered to reply also mic with team doesnt not work properly most time they cant hear me or i can only hear one etc,3
Pathetic update. I am not able to hear what my team mates are speaking during the match. That makes the multiplayer mode very boring. Please solve this bug,3
"Nice game, I like it! Its more fun than others BR games, more action but before update it was running perfectly on high graphics, now its starting to drop frames sometimes, I have Snapdragon 845",3
"I actually love this game, it may be one of the best moible games ever. However, I wont rate it as a 5 stars game because 8 out of 10 while I'm playing Battle Royal games my screen would turn black and I have to restart the game. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only player that have the screen turning black while playing BR, there are a lot of players frustrated by this. Overall, the game is excellent but not perfect.",3
For me the game is great im a sniper but i would like to say thwt some of the dlc weapons are horrible and regular weapons are unplayable on certain maps especially when you have a choppy phone in terms of how the game is its fun but there a little but of problems that can be changed,3
Gameplay is smooth and fun. But I can't watch any intel briefings/ad videos that reward with credits in-game. Look into this. The Play Store still shows option to join beta.,3
"It's very annoying me, when I play the battel royal, game 2 or 3 times. It's lagging and screen gets black... Even as my phone have 4gb ram.. so.. I want to tell u all the community of ACTIVISION fix this.. ASAP. Please.",3
In the most recent update I'm not able to login to my account with out it sending me to the login page but it's a good game I recommend it but just fix that bug that I can't get in to my acount,3
Its a good game but you guys need to fix battle royale because every time i play that mode it always kicks me out of the match or the game will crash also is puts me in matchs that already has been started besides that its a good game,3
"Pretty good game, but after the new update, every time my network fluctuates a bit, thw game disconnects me from the match and deducts exp even though i connect back within 5 seconds.",3
A good game but the cost of the prize draw and the odds of getting the better items are a joke. The good thing is that makes it easy not to spend any money on this game.,3
"My only issue is on battle royale it freezes in mid game and I have to restart the whole thing. Hope it gets fix, Other than that the game is great.",3
"Overall a really cool game to play, HOWEVER, the app will crash in the middle of gameplay, that the developers have not fixed yet as of season 5. Hopefully this bug will be fixed in the near future. UPDATE... Season 7 now here and still no fix on game play freezing up in the middle of the game. I have the Samsung S10+ so its not a phone issue, nor is it internet either.",3
The game is good. U need to optimize the game for better performance. There are many things in the game which is of no use like the zombie mode or the items which are expired. You need to clear them as they r taking useless space and increasing the size of the game unnecessarily. Even we feel irritated seen thing in the game which are of no use to us.,3
Fun af! Addictive is an understatement. Not P2W. Get it. Tell your wife and kids you're sorry for not spending any time with them. Something new that's happening needs to be fixed: you can't autofire on anyone in the prone position. This is really annoying devs. Please fix and I'll change my rating back to 5 stars. Thanks.,3
"New updates are horrible. Game keep hangs, sounds for the weapons totaly changed and has lost its origional sounds. It was suppose to be the best but went worst. Please change the sounds",3
The game was actually kinda fun but when I updated the game I went from an elite 1 to rookie 4. It took me so long to get to elite and now all of my progress in ranked matches is gone.,3
"The game is very enjoyable.However ,for those in Africa, you'll just have to deal with being kicked out of matches due to server disconnections or constant lag.Good luck getting a server in Africa.",3
"Good game but still requires a lot of work, audio in matches is a mess, I share the same cause with other players about the behavior of some of the members of the community, when they got AFK, they just bring down the overall of the team leading into a lose, also, BR fights has some issues with the lag, even if you keep your phone in low settings.",3
"Keeps freezing in ranked matches and forces me to close out of window then penalizes me. Happens every time I play. Also, ranked matches have unfair connection to host and servers.",3
It has a great gameplay the logs get more worst in dis update plz fix i can't even get to shoot by the time i aim i die plz plz plz fix it or I'll have to uninstall which i don't want but i will have too if it's not fix plz help help help!!! Plz give mi some hope that u guys will fix it asap,3
"Everything's good except the fact they removed ranked selection. Coz most of the people hates snd please remove it or bring back the ""Rank Selection Mode"" many of us hate it do a check on it and please do something about SND or atleast decrease it's percentage in ranked",3
I changed my rating from a 5 to a 3 the mic system STILL isn't working correctly. Some play requires mics and this system is BROKEN! new update which was delayed by a week and instantly NO MIC had to restart 10x just to get it to work again worked for 1 game and stopped again.,3
good graphics great gameplay the game physics is so realistic and there are lots of updates weekly and monthly. I had to change my rating from 5 to 3 since my game keeps crashing after the update. Please fix the issue,3
"Amazing game, and graphics, but has a bug where it just will not let me move and a low WiFi sign comes up, I have 100mb per second very fast broadband, so there is nothing wrong with my wifi, please fix",3
We are facing issue communicating with team members in the new version. Sometime we can hear. Sometime we can't. Please fix this soon..,3
"The game is great but there are some flaws. No. 1 If you are wearing a level 3 vest, hit the target with a full burst but you end up in 2 rounds. No. 2 When you wear a printable feature sticker that indicates a feature within a short radius, it sometimes does not work on time. In No. 3 Warfare the mountain stream drains, the sea is all but not a field of sand. Not a thick forest.And there is much more to tell but so much better. So I will give it 3 stars.",3
Decrease the game size plz,3
Anyone else having music playing constantly on a loop whilst in game? Started a few days ago and is very annoying!,3
I wish I could pay for cp. But I can't. So please put a free way to get cp for free. I love the game anyway.,3

It's just pay to win now,3
Dropping to 3 stars. Game plays perfect. I have several connection issues. I already contacted customer support. Please fix,3
"The game is overall great both fpp and tpp modes. New game modes and weapons keep the game fresh but the amount of lag and bugs in the game is unreal. I've a 2 GB ram phone with adreno graphics and it still randomly freezes. Even my friends with better phones face the problem. Then the audio glitch, the mic stops working and I cant hear my friends unless I either restart the game or sometimes I've to completely reinstall it. Fix these bugs and I'm sure it will be a banger.",3
My screen goes blank in the middle of every battle royal game I play on my Samsung galaxy A70. I'd have to restart the game in order to continue. Kindly fix this issue.,3
Had to Change my rating to 3 stars Coz of the lagging even when the ping is 82/83 ms... will Change it back to 5 stars once the problem is resolved!! 🤞,3
Everything is good in game but all the time I am just facing is excessive ping. I have great internet bit everytime my ping is above 100ms,3
Team death match is awesome but still need to upgrade the battle royale mode. Need more maps.,3
"Ads aren't working, i tried to purchase some CP didn't worked aswell. Fix that please. Overall it's a good game.",3

I think the damage output is much higher and when you are in the aim of somebody you just can't escape it.though the overall classes and skils and scorestreaks are much better than in pubg. I still fell you need to do something in ballttle royale. The multiplayer is my favourite and has nice and proper damage output.,3
The controlls are terrible. Simple firing mode is the worst thing I've ever seen and it's takes a while to swop modes,3
"Good stuff, it crashes now tho like when i start a match it blacks out",3

Great app but keeps crashing costing me points in ranked,3
Nice game,3
Ranked is trash. You get forced to play game modes you hate as they took away the option to choose modes. There are a lot of hackers and try hards too. The game puts you against people with better ping constantly (my ping is amazing so I don't know if they are using computer or what) and you will see yourself getting killed on a killcam even though on your screen you were already behind cover. People using mobile should never be matched against computer players or players with controllers. Fix.,3
I try to get my own acount but it gives me sombody elses acount and i dont LIKE IT!!😡😡,3
the game is good but there's many hacker pls fix this,3
While playing multiplayer mode sometime game freezes and after a moment my character move to another place. I think this need to be fixed.,3
"Alot of fun. Plays like old school cod, BUT the crates have all the feel of getting ripped off... The draws are even worse and it's extremely clear that the only way to get the ""jackpot"" is too spend enough too do every single roll. Worse odds than Win star 😂",3
"Very nice game, Please, can you put that we can choice the squad for a team where we came from, like we can make a squad in a same country, thanks",3
Initially gave 5 stars but Season 7 sucks. Wheres capture the flag?????? U guys removed one of the most fun game modes. I dont understahd why. And there are so many cheaters man its crazy.,3
I gave this app 5 star but now I am forced to make it into 3 star. The game is absolutely wonderful but there are some glitches. Sometimes I have no damage glitch. When I shoot at enemies the bullets go through people and no hitmarkers are shown. Also the game becomes very laggy even though I have good and stable internet connection. But still I Olay this game hoping that the developers fixes the bugs and glitches.,3
Lost my phone that had my main account and I did the login with the e mail and password and it did not work,3
Was doing good till the season 7 update. Now every time i play my phone crashes,3
I hate this game now because they deleted zombie mode is very fun because my friends are missing it cod add this in session 8 pls or else one star and deleted this game if do five stars and keep the game,3
Its good everything is good except for br where the lag makes me need to restart the app and reconnect to the game,3
"Turn of the music background. Can't really hear the enemy coming, because of the background music playing. Other than that everything is fine",3
With new update getting tons of lag. Thought it was my internet provider but looks like a ton of people are having the same issue.,3
It's PUBG but with more mode,3
"Fun game to play, just hate that to get most items you have to pay for them.",3
Since my last review COD has had some issues with the mic and some of the glitches. But other then that this game is so addictive and fun thanks soo much,3
"There are many serious bugs in the voix chat, I also can't filter team up with mic enabled players or even players with a specific language, and I wish to see a rewards system based on tasks similar to pubg , the current one is confusing and useless.",3
"When we are updating the came some function""s are working slowly and some fast . Like : when we invite or join with our friend""s that time our Mike is not working perfect and when we enter in game that time the camera is moving fastly .",3
"This game is very fantastic, but THE LAG IS F***** UNREAL!!! Fix freaking everything!!!! For sure there are no lags on ANY recent iPhone's and it just so f annoying that I have to deal with F EVERYTHING: LAGS, MISSED SHOTS (P.S. when I damaged players, it doesn't affect their hp) AND FU HACKERS FROM CONTROLLER MOBILE PLAYERS!!!! Please ban ALL cheating players...",3
the image in the game is black. i play on the pc,3
It's allright depends on your phone,3

I downloaded this app multiple times with more then enough storage. When it finally downloaded it want load at the loading screen! ?,3
"First time playing, preety cool for now, gonna check out to check out the rest",3
5/5 😎🔥🔥 Game was awesome up until the other day where I was unable to Login. Attempted numerous password resets never recieved one. 100% the email used to register. Disappointed as I really enjoyed playing 😔 changed my rating from 5/5 to 3/5.,3
"Pretty good game, but the voice chats always have problem since season 1 and is currently in season 5 and is worse now. That is annoying Everytime and make player don't want to play sometimes.",3
"It is ok I guess, but i uninstalled this because it is repeated game. repeat and repeat that is all",3
It is very gleche.,3
"I am using samsung galaxy J7 and i dont have mic and speaker in game ,if you could help me in this i'll give you 5stars btw MP is Awesome.",3
im trying to play on my chromebook,3
Good app but random back round music i cant turn off started after update,3

I kinda like it but you guys need to add zombies what is call of duty with out zombies,3
"Repeat Crash, Moto g7 power. The game loads for about 1 minute and then crashes after the latest update. Please fix!",3
Awesome i also have a request for the game please add in the desert eagle with long barrel attachment please i have been playing ever since the game was released i am level 93 plz respond the game takes so long to load up in ranked,3
It is a nice game but there is where the (ms) goes high and when it seytled you are dead and usually in battle royal. You guys need to resolve thus,3
After the new update I'm in level 113 and I get killed by people who are in level 150. Please make it fair......they always use legendary guns Even in Battle Royale my squad members are always noobs And other squads have level 150 players It's been impossible to kill people with the tank,3
"Game won't let me watch any videos for the Intel briefings. Also, having to pay $5 for a name change card is crazy. No games charge to change your name. I didn't even get the option to change it when I downloaded the game.",3
"The game do not run smooth it is not been optimised. The graphics is too goo, I rated only 3 star because only for lag, and the main reason that the ms is too high sometime playing battle royal. Please fix it I will change my rating.",3
"Was initially a great game until the last update, I can no longer download the game to play it...",3
What's going on with the mic?? Can't invite people to games. Can't play a ranked game unless teamed up which I can't do as the requests dont send. Update has caused so many glitches,3
"Mic issue.. Group matches with frienda frequent problem to speak within team. When it ll be clear. Difficult to play along with friends. Frustrated to switch between team,friend,none and it works 1 or 2 in a team. How could we play with this in Battle Royale? Its gonna be a weak from the last update but still this problem persist.",3
Server connectivity bugs just ruined this game,3
"The new update is pathetic! The microphone disconnects and connects anytime it totally ruins the experience and gameplay! I have to restart the game all over if I want to switch from BR to Multiplayer cause then the voice does not connect. Even then it gets disconnected anytime bewteen the game. Also for BR, if once I join and leave a room, when I rejoin a room the voice does not connect again! So basically for every new room I have to restart the damn game again! My phone- Samsung J6. Fix asap.",3
Voice issues with the new update!! Very poor voice connection.,3
M4 availability should be more. Not only though aiddrop.,3
"The game is really great as usual , but with the new season 7 update the mic issue has been causing a lot of problems. Audio works clearly but your teammate can't hear what you say... please resolve this. Thank you",3
The game lags,3
Graphic is lower than pubg Take too much time in opening. THANKS,3

"Multiplayer mode is nice except one thing, I Couldn't communicate with my friends in it , and i reported it more than twice, but its still not fixed, if the developer reads my review, please fix it!!......please its really inconvenient.....please fix it ASAP",3
"Almost all of the time I play with a controller, the game lags and/or times out, even disconnecting me from my wifi. Not as bad of an issue when I'm not using a controller, but still happens. Also, why does disconnecting from a ranked match give you a penalty? Leaving is justified, but when the game blatantly tells you that you disconnected you STILL get a penalty?",3
Very sexist to pay $50 for a female character. We play too.,3
Don't get me wrong i love COD and i grew up playing it but since the last update all the graphics are glitching and there is a LOT of map glitches and audio issues and i honestly don't like the amount of microtransactions appering every now and then. But i absolutely love the ADS and the first person prespictive .,3
"I have few suggestions and queries.... 1st. Tank should remove from single and double team BR Game or You may add Tank as a Class. It'll help every team. And make battle equal. 2nd. When we want to send invitation in Clan or world platform, the invitation only goes or accepted by same rank players ( automatically) 3rd. Some strict penalty for those who left the team after joining. 4th. Monthly review should be taken from all users for make this app NO 01.",3

The voice chat is not working in game.,3
A very good game but i was elite 4.. I quit the game amd started plying it again... I realised that i lost everything... I am vry sad about it as i spent 5hrs straight trying to push for rank... Btw i happened to me 3 times.. I had enough.. Just unistalled the game... I hope Activision see dis... I wanted to rate the game 5/5 but i could not,3
Was originally a 4 but now a 3 because of the constant glitches and connection errors giving you massive amounts of lag and the new tank in battle royale which ruins the game as it is so over powered and whoever gets it generally wins he game,3
Awesome game over all.but you can't just log In through your Google account I changed my password and tried about 10 times.and why are they asking for my Google account pass.plz reply codm,3
awesome,3
Very good gameplay but requires great internet and doesn't really have good skins and a really expensive battle pass. I say the next season should be about the coronavirus and in the gameplay you can only fight from 2m away that makes the game more interesting and can you please make better skins for free.,3
This game glitches everytime played also hangs up on multiples occasions new update has made it worse you can certainly play this game but cannot enjoy it due to the constant interruptions in the form of glitches and lags,3
Even if less people are playing the zombie why did you have to remove it? Please bring it back!,3
Superb Best gaming feature but game controls should be some more modified,3
Please fix the blackscreen issue ... It just blacksout while gaming and that is affecting my rankings ... Disappointing 💔,3
"This is a fantastic game, but with more features, more fun. Jump, peek & fire, Trinig Mod.is Even better.thank you",3
"Hello codm developers i would like to share my experience with you, i downloaded this game because my friend suggested.I rated it 5 🌟 but due the big updates i need to reinstall it all the time but in the previous season i lost over 400 points just by rank penalty because my game start crashing. But i reinstalled it in this update and really loved it because my game was not crashing till now but today my game crash 2 times i was about to go master 3 but due to rank penalty i lost110 point Help",3
"3 star, for I won't be playing until the game auto closing on v1.5 is corrected.",3
rank match start in mobile but not in gameloop emulator you need to improve it,3
Its good but when im running from one place to anouther it sends me back to the same place well im running i even shot a guy well running and it sent me back to the building oi was in like bruh fix that develipore also i hate when we are in ranked and when we lose we barely rank up like it just gives your rank a tiny bost so trashhh like at this rate poeple who keep losing will litraly stop playing ranked cuz it will take for ever just to rank up like dued,3
The multiplayer mode is better but i think battle royale is horrible and if u shoot it doesnt fire on target also i hate the driving,3
"Microphone is not working most of the game, i can't hear my team members",3
Good game but since the latest update been having a hard time getting into the game it always says I have not internet connection but I do,3
There is a slight video lag and the game is not as smooth as it was last season,3
HACKERS 😋😋😋,3
It's really fun but it takes a lot of space,3
Would be give stars if I could unlink my FB account as I somehow didn't link them properly and now have 2 seperate COD accounts 😭,3
"Good...Very good grafics...But, I give only 3 star because there are only one map in ""Royal Battle"" mode...You have to add up to 4 diffrent maps in Royal Battle like PUBG...No Matter that the game size is increase by this...And keep quality also.",3
Great game... Don't get me wrong... But with warzone there are too many updates so users should still get the option to play rest of the modes without updating.,3
"Ever since the new update, the mic has been worse, i cant hear my teammates and they cant hear, sometimea they can and my connection is fine and you know communication is key in a battle.",3
"Awesome Game! Just wish they wld sort put all the bugs, lagging and mic issues! Really makes the game unpleasant! Really is an awesome game but these issues need to get sorted out asap!",3
"New update has made the game extremely laggy please do something, bring some fix for this...",3
Game Always ask for full Internet access despite of having internet can not be able to play game 😡,3
I want to give 5star but the update again again coming 2gb 1gb please stop give like 509mb update,3
its awesome!!!,3
"please fix it ! keep having trouble with automation login and keep sign out and wont let me sign in , i have to do is recovery password and nothing happen, and also it shown that error 2 and 11???",3
Now since you guys have added new places in BR map the another thing that I would to see is that graphics getting more original that's the only thing which looks like leftover whenever I play in BR like making houses more original even though my settings are on vey high in graphics still something's looks leftover the rest of the game is FANTASTIC,3
Post my android 10 update. In my one plus 5 phone.. the game is not getting launched.,3
Game is extremely good But please fix the problem Always showing network error I am sick of this,3
I do have some trouble with multiplayer match. I can't play multiplayer match very often one day maximum 5 times. The loading screen count upto 150 then also the match won't start,3
Op game Beatr then freefire,3
"Lots of cheaters unfortunately. I don't see they are doing anything against. Also all the time they increase the number of clicks, now I have to click 10 times after match finishes.. annoying. Ranked match should be search & destroy free, you depend too much on others in the team.",3
There's a lot of anoying hackers and cheaters that don't know how to play. The game is great 👍👌 but hackers and cheaters trainers...etc. ruin the game like every other because they don't know how to play GAMES.,3
"This is a good game. As always improvements can be made. My biggest complaint other than the lag is that the voice chat doesnt always work. Ill turn it on and ill be able to hear them. But as soon as game starts no matter how many times i toggle the mic button or the speaker button, i cant hear them and they cant hear me. Not just during battle royale but also multiplayer. Would really appreciate if this was addressed in the next update please.",4
"The game overall is great ! The way the BR has been designed, with all the tricks & stuff makes the game really fun to play. But 2 issues I have a problem with is the lagging that occurs in the game, like dear God ! You have such a cool kickass game but it lags like I am running it on a two - bit device, what is even the point ? The moment my net connection goes from good to better, your game starts glitching. And what's with the tanks in the new update ? It makes the gameplay so unfair.",4
"CODM is an awesome Game. When I started initially it wasn't easy but with time I got used to the game and I'm now addictive. However, the only challenge I face is in terms of acquiring weapons. It's quite hard to acquire suffisticated weapons while your counterparts are using such weapons. And I also wish if the game could be played in an offline mode that would not require Data Charges for easy access and Maybe a Storyline. Thanks very much. I say a big well done to the producers.",4
"There are very few times that my game doesn't lag or glitch. It's frustrating because can be shooting at a target 10 fast rounds and it doesn't affect the target. I love the game, I'm addicted to this game. It can improve most definitely so it doesn't run so much on data. But even on wifi my game has many lags and glitches. Also the weapon is also and issue. It sucks that I'm not able to aquire awesome weapons like my opposing team.",4
"Good game in general. You can probably trick a person into thinking this is a console game. The one flaw is crates and lucky draws, because nobody wants to waste their money on a gun skin they dont even know if they want to get. Since there are now bundles, that kind of solves the problem except for the fact that most of the good skins are in crates and lucky draws.",4
I would of given you 5 stars but the only problem is that when I'm not in advanced mode I can't kill the people who are crawling so they can kill me but I can't kill them. Plus if I crawl they can still hit me so yeah. But besides that I love your game its amazing and fun and I hope you can get that little bug fixed. Or is it a bug... Dan Dan daaan. 😦🤔😀,4
"After the new gameplay is awesom not only me but my friends are also facing many problems like: 1. The game is lagging a lot. 2. The microphone doesn't work most of the time, especially in BR. 3. While playing the game I got stuck in a wall. 4. Sometimes the game stops in between the matches. I love this game so much, so I couldn't give less then 4 rating. I hope you guys fix it soon.",4
"The game itself is amazing, but simplify the damn menus. There's a hundreds of things to click and tap on, so many menu delays until you can rejoin another game. Make things more easy and fast on the menus. It's way too much to navigate through. And way too many pop ups. And please add an option to items like ""mark as all viewed"" it's annoying to see the yellow icon, which you have to get the d of by tapping in each consecutive menu to make it disappear.",4
Lately I have had some trouble with the game since the launch of the new season. First sometimes it so happens that I am unable to join a ranked match due to some issues from the side of Activision and then next I know I'm fined 50 points in ranked for leaving a ranked game inthe midst. This isn't fair to us seeing how hard it is to rank up every single game. I would give 5 stars if this was sorted!,4
"I really like the game, the graphics etc but the only thing that I don't like is the free battle pass pass. Every time it come I always hope you will give us CP, But no. I would really appreciate it if you and the cod team will do it. I have recommended this game to my friends too and yeah there are some people who don't get the CP . You know why",4
"Well, I really enjoyed playing this game. Attractive battles, outstanding weapons etc. Maps are also wonderful. But, I do suggest- Warfare (Multi Player Battle Royal), should be available all the time. In season 7-Weapons ability is increased, but, they should also increase the Player's withstanding ability and power. Also, the One tank dropped by Air drop, is not so useful, since, the player capturing that Tank can survive, and it's not good! Also, more items should be given for free!!!",4
"At first I was reluctant to try it. But it's awesome! I wish more weapons will be added (for variety like on PC) especially on the lower-mid levels. Also, please add tips for people new to the game i.e joining a clan. Also, some people have maxed out already. I hope they expand the game to allow progressive play.",4
"Amazing fun and a great experience with friends. There are a few problems though. There is a lot of lag which is frustrating and lethal mid game. Also Battle Royale sometimes has a black screen problem after a while, you can still hear the game continuing but you are completely blind and can't continue. 5 stars otherwise!!",4
It use to be a 5 star game but the removal of zombies has removed some of the fun. My only complaint is the controller option. My personal opinion is it needs removed all together or at least please do better at making sure screen players don't get paired with controller players. You guys have done pretty well but I still find myself paired or opposing other players who use the controller.,4
"The game is really good it's fun, and I could play it for hours on end. The only reason I'm not giving this game a full five stars is because of the tanks in Battle Royale mode, They're too Toxic and Overpowered, They're too hard to destroy and one good player could easily get 10 kills, im not saying take them out necessarily, but at least nerf them heavily.",4
"The game is damn good and entertaining. But the reason why I have given a 4 star is bcz the mic and speaker have not been developed properly. Even though my mic and speaker both are turned on, while playing multiplayer, sometimes my teammates have a problem hearing my voice or I cannot hear them even though their mic and speaker is turned on.",4
It is a really a awesome game than pubg. U know what I liked in this game is the high grafic and the smooth running of the game. And the characters are also very cool. And the saw of playing this game is awesome man. Really man it kills. What I say is that at least once u play this game in your life and see what a dynamic feeling u will get. - thank you At last I really thank for the creator of this game and their team who made this game awesome. Thanks a lot once again guys.,4
"I am giving this app 4 star cause even if I have login in my cod account they are always making a new account. Even if I tried to change the password still they are creating a new account for me. Kindly repair this bug. By the way, the gameplay and graphics are always the best. I really appreciate the work of the creater of this game.",4
Ok all my requests were listened in the new gameplay is awesom. The ping has improved and so has the friends menu. Tho I still have a few requests. In the new gameplay is awesomes the first menu is the all menu which I don't like tbh. Br bugs have improved but the frame rate drops dramatically and there is a voice chat bug. Like sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. It's really annoying and I've enabled all permissions and checked everything. Pls help and fix. Otherwise awesome game and thanks for the awesome gameplay is awesome. Thank you,4
"All in all great game and definitely worth getting. Battle royale is great but when you're walking in buildings or whatever and theres loot on the ground, the guns ect dont show up on the floor. You'll have to walk round aimlessly until it comes up onto your nearby list. Also recently I've had issues where the game completely glitches out and restarts my phone which is very frustrating! However when it actually works it's the probably best COD-like game.",4
"Sad to say, i really love this game, but after the latest gameplay is awesome, Battle royal lags a lot, and the mic for some reason never works, have to use discord now. Please look into this matter, really is a pain and its good for the championship, will give other a advantage.. Thank you.. Could you please give south africans a server aswell? Ping is also good and we have been in lobbys where other's ping is better, again, gives other a advantage..",4
"Love it. Doesn't have issues like pubg or fortnight. Runs as smooth as Kaboom. The mic. actually works without wifi. But lucky draws are fixed and too expensive basically a scam. game shorted me on 25 bucks in credit. purchases are unreliable. 😫crate chance too low+expensive. Every-time I buy something, something better comes along to make me regret it. I want a spenders reward for people that spend 200 or more into it. Need 3rd party controller mapping or support bought 2 that said they-work lie Thank you",4
"Really liked the new gameplay is awesome. But there is a problem with the mic when playing, we need to manually change from friend to team. Previously it was in auto, so with this issue i thought it was of my device and i switched to emulator, the same issue happens there too. Kindly Please look into it. Thank You🙂 I'll give 5 stars after fixing this issue🔥",4
"Game is great itself and love new maps and guns but the only problem I have as many many other is a microphone, it doesn't work most of the time, sometimes I gotta restart the game 5 times to be finally able to hear and talk to my friends, please fix this issue. On other hand well done! Such a great game!",4
Really good game but if you can't shoot through wood crates why can you shoot through brick wall and *metal* walls. Also if you make a challenge that says win 10 rounds on a map why would you make it so that we can't even choose that make to begin with that would make this game a lot more enjoyable. Also the gameplay is awesomes are the biggest ever like one gameplay is awesome was 2.7 gigs that's more than the game itself I have no room for like anything else and it sucks.,4
"There are sone voice glitches in the lobby and also in battle royal mode. Sometimes we can hear our team mates in the lobby and suddenly when we enter battle royal, no one can hear no one in the team radio. Please fix and give more cheap stuffs to buy bcoz most of it is really expensive. Try to give more cheap and cool stuffs so that an average player can get new characters and stuffs easily. I have been a pubgm player for the last 2 years but now It's time for CODM to shine hopefully. Cheers!!",4
"It's multiplayer mode is the best compair to other mobile games. Battle royal has ranked attachments that don't make sense. Plus it has auto shoot has a bit delay in time which is fine. The auto doesn't shoot when the enemy is prone and it doesn't even shoot trip mine n RCs when aimed at them. I wish the fix this issues. And people say the gun status aren't correct, but I don't know if any game has it correct.",4
"The new season 8 implemented is quite fun. But for a new player to not know about the seasons before they end like season 8 where I had completed all but one objective to get the Cordite and where I received NO indication to do any of those objectives until it was practically the last day. ALL my progress was for naught as it completely erased everything and changed to the new season which was quite annoying; so I had almost wanted to quit altogether, but this new season is cool so I'll stay.",4
The game is awesome....but I couldn't able to draw my lucky board from the day 1 of season 7 and I have also reported at lucky board but no response. COD team can you please check out my(ID- ElenaGilbert09) issue. The screen displays You have watched all your intel briefings for today. You can watch more intel briefings after midnight UTC. Look into the issue and revert me back..... Thanks in advance COD team. Awaiting for your response.,4
"Thissss gameee my all time fav! I admired this cod franchise from my childhood.....and I don't want it to be ruined... after the gameplay is awesome the game has many issues like in match making, server issues , ping and etc ....but what annoyed me the most is the rendering issues ....like someone kills me even when I am not in the frame THIS IS MOSTTT ANNOYING!! plzzzzzz fix it .....I planned on getting into the leader board this season and this issue sucksI pushed so hard to get into legendary with 8000pts",4
"I don't really play it anymore but this might be one of the best FPS games on mobile. That wasn't surprising since Tencent also made PUBG mobile. Partial controller support, nice and relatively intuitive controls combined with at least decent graphics. Everything else is just your normal CoD experience with overloaded menus and annoying leveling. Push notifications are a nightmare though.",4
"I love this game, it's the best mobile game I've ever played. I love how the game isn't a pay to win game so free to play players can also enjoy the game. However, there is a problem with the mic. Even when I turn it on, either my friends cant hear me or I cant hear my friends. I also hope you'll change the way you add friends into the queue, bcs I have to select friend each time I want to invite.",4
"it's very nice game , it's enjoyable game and it is very addictive game and it has very good graphics and it has many good gameplay is awesome per week so very enjoyable game and it is the best multiplayer game. And I will give you five star if you solve the gameplay is awesome problem ok .👍the problem is happening like it's not updating in first time and it's not going up after 1% its showing download pending ok. Thank you",4
The gaming is awesome but I do hate it lags when I get notifications from other apps.. I'll have to turn off all notifications but other than that I'm able to play great. Wish there were more ways to get the cool stuff instead of paying when bu the next season or so itll be something newer youd want. It should all be obtainable by either purchasing or completing tasks.,4
"ERROR!! An error is showing everytime I want to start the game though I have a good internet connection. The error message says ""Sorry, there was an error during the Google Play download. Please make sure you're connected to a stable network and try again later. If you can't solve it, please go to the official website or community pages for help"" Please Help me to resolve this issue",4
"It is best game I had ever played....but still there is a room for improvement. But the latest update has a lot of bugs and glitches. And till now I think season 6 was better. There is a ranking problem stuff and also the points in rank are not increasing that much as that was in season 6 BR. I have encountered one of the biggest bug in the game like the loading screen glitch, in mic button, a small lag in between game(also lobby),etc.",4
"Great gaming experience. Wonderful graphics. Crisp game movement and sensitivity. Giving only 4 stars here as there is a glitch in multiplayer mode - when the opponent is in prone mode, our weapon does not catch aim - which is so unfair at many instances in the game play. Hope the developers could improve on this. Otherwise all great !",4
I love the game it is rilly fun and enjoyable to play with friends I play it every day. But I do not like how you have to pay to get CP points or the battle pass. But I do like that you can talk to your friends and teammates through the game. But since season 6 came out the voice chat has not been working right and I am pretty shure that all the crates are rigged.,4
"Great game that I can only recommend I have a lot of fun playing . I do have some issues with lag even though have a good wifi. But my main problem is that lately I can not log in as the ""download configuration as failed "" even though I am connected with a strong connection. If anybody as encountered this issue I would love a solution or explanations. That said when it's working the game is amazing.",4
"-1 star 🌟 First thank you a lot for the big change in S7, and the gameplay in battal rotal become more good. 🚫But, Multiplayer game has a big real issue and with time it is becoming more worse which is the Gun list!!!!!!!!! Why you don't sort all gun skin and upgrade 1,2,3,4,5 in folder forgun name!!! As same as the battal Royal Gun list 📃 Wish a lot this come happen as fast ad you can",4
There has been a issue with the game recently... The mic doesn't seem to work properly when playing with my team. My fellow team mates are not able to hear me. Even they face this issue sometimes. We have to log off the game and log in sometimes for the mic to respond. Kindly solve this issue asap.,4
"Game is amazing, but I have a problem. Earlier on my wifi was having problems (still is) and it disconnected me from 2 games (ranked matches). I couldnt reconnect so it made me do the penalty. Please make a system that detects when players disconnect due to other reasons and not that they purposefully disconnect.",4
"Very fun game. Even on 2.4Ghz wifi, with Bluetooth earbuds connected, I can play with a solid ping that causes no problems for other players. I may not have been playing for very long (two or three weeks approx.) But I haven't noticed any glaring p2w aspects to this game at all. I've heard of people having connection issues, or random bugs in the middle of some maps that make it unplayable, but I haven't experienced these issues myself. But the random screams at nothing are beyond annoying.",4
Great game. Play to win not pay to win. Some of the packs are worth spending if you like to look good lol. I like the mobile experience over console with the updates providing more of the console experience. I rate it a 4 only because you need a good processor to compete at a higher level.,4
"I love this game, it's literally the best I could find for this genre. The graphics are simply amazing and everything is smooth and just wow. But with the recent update I discovered something I do absolutely not like: ppl started spawning EVERYWHERE. I once spawned directly into the enemies spawn point and other times they spawned RIGHT BEHIND MY BACK!! I really love this game and wouldn't abandon it for the world but please just change that. It's really just annoying and pisses everyone off.",4
"Its an amazing game....great graphics, great gameplay, brilliant concepts. The only reason i gave it a 4 star was because of its lag (especially in battle royale). Though i get a ping of 50, I lag so often in br, especially when i'm fighting an enemy. Other than this, it is overall an amazing game.",4
"This is the best game I've ever played on mobile,but there's too much lagging.I updated the game earlier this morning and still haven't played a match yet because it can't connect to the game before the match.And the aiming sights are not really that good.I recommend you add more scopes in Battle Royale,like PUBG Mobile,they have lots of scopes and their scopes are great for long and short range.I hope U see this and try to fix the lagging bug and add more scopes in the next update. Thank you",4
"I like the game but there are a few things that don't make sense. You ""*"" out any good words but in the comic last season there are a few good words in there. Also bomb and kill is ""*"" out that doesn't make any sense because you kill each other through the whole game. Tanks also needs to be removed or take them out of solo. Edit: In rank I lose to many rank points due to my teammates y'all should make it were the top three on the losing team doesn't get point taken away.",4
"One of the best shooting game. It's more flawless and enjoyable with high speed data connection, but the story is completely different for slow and moderate data speed. Game has lagging issues for slow data speed. Instead of providing the same weapons in different colours, if more new weapons are being added to the game it will add some extra charm to the game. Please do add some more maps to frontline in mp mode. Lastly it's the best shooting game. Thanks",4
"Very good, what a fps mobile should be like yo! If it changes for better or worse Ill post. P they been fkn with the mp gun accuracy, it seems like it's gotten off point... Which ssux, 6/11/20 update made and BR mode has changed, parachute seemed slow to land and uncontrollable, scope was wavy, but these things seemed more idk real in a good way. But the lag was unheard of not like good connection lag but like odd slow movement, maybe maybe it's my devices, which sux emphasis on cod MOBILE",4
"I don't know what kind of changes you guys made in the audio aspect of the game, but the comms are not working anymore. I either cant hear my teammates or they can't hear me. Its pretty annoying. Makes me not wanna play squad at all! Fix this guys or else you guys are gonna lose of lot of active players.",4
it's a great game perfect graphics . but the new tank item is some how unfair because it's really hard to destroy tank and the team which gets the tank first is some how the winner it's really bothering when you get killed by the tank by an unskilled player only because you can't destroy the tank. in my opinion if there was a time limit of 2 or 3 minutes of using the tank or it was much easier to destroy it or delete the tank item from the game it could be much fair and enjoying. Thank you,4
"Best mobile FPS period, if you have a oneplus device dont get the game is extremely frustrating to lag or black screen in middle of a match. I been playing since it came out and is an amazing game experience but the crate draws is a waist of cp unless you purchase 10 of them been wasting my cp on crates with useless items. Just piss about that flaw i feel cheated . Not purchasing nothing else but base battle pass. Just got a new phone and it works flawless I guess they can't support them all.",4
I love this game but for me it takes a while to load. Also I'm not sure if when the game randomize teams u be playing against people our own level. So I think that we should always play against our own level unless u join a game with ur friend and they on higher levels. Anyhow like I said I love this game,4
"Just like the games you play on the system but in a Mini version it's awesome ! however now when only playing battle royal it only occasionally crashes on me and goes black l, but the new update looks fantastic especially worg tanks but im lagging so much from time to time but its gotten better but wish i can get compensated for the blackouts.",4
"Game has developed a long way from its initial update. They almost fixed every bug in the game that was initially found. But there are still some bugs present. There is a network issue, that shots never connect even if u correctly aim, even in the lowest ping possible. Still not a smooth experience as u would get from a console COD. Snipers doesn't shoot while scoping out (while using scope and shoot button separately). So sniping here is totally different from other CODs.",4
"I was excited about the S7 update & am so happy about it. But, I noticed that in Battle Royale the display size of teammates & their classes is too small which is pretty good. Hope u guys r gonna fix it as I couldn't find any options for it in settings to change the size of it. Before the update it was good n clearly visible but, now I can barely read the names n identify the classes. Thank you",4
I love the game no doubt on that. Have been playing since COD was introduced to PC games. The mobile version is also good but sometimes when you enter a MP matches the team you are on is always losing as the game has already started which i hate it. It should be 0-0 on both sides when u enter a match. Battle Royal mode should have new maps. Thats it. Everything's great so far.,4
"The game is really good but the recent update brought in a new ""lucky board"" where I can get in-game characters, skins, etc. by watching an ad which is just stubborn as it can get to deny chance to them and tells me that I've exceeded my quota for the ads for the day, while I haven't (unable to) seen even one ad from the day of the update. Pls fix this ASAP",4
"Fun game, good graphics. Hope they get more different weapons, not just different skins for them. Also the game would randomly freeze up on me to where the only way to continue the game is if I would close out the game completely, then start it back up right away. If the match is still going when, you can resume the gameplay. And if u are playing BR and during the time when you're restarting your phone, if you get killed then it would resume to the same screen as you would regularly when u die Thank you",4
"The game was fine until the last update. It seems that the main screen was cut and pasted over and over in layers, to the point that it is hard to tell what is what. The game also has trouble loading the 3D weapons to show what it is you are looking at. Overall it is an excellent game that is very enjoyable to play. On an unrelated note the hip fire is somewhat difficult to do as the joystick to look around is on the same side as the hip fire button is. 5 stars if above issues are resolved.",4
"Great multiplayer game, shame there is no zombies mode.. would be great if they could get the old maps from waw and black opps for zombies then add some crazy Easter eggs, Aliens (I could shoot Roger from family guy easy) and add new unlockable secret weapons that you can pakka punch so you blow them up in style.. make the game fun and playable and you've got probably the best game released .. ever, but it's a good game in total.",4
Out of every mobile game I've played this is the best..but the worse thing is that if you buy the battle pass and get to like even tier 100 you won't get the next battle pass for free that really concerns me bcz..like in pubg they will give you the next battle pass for free if you complete the previous(only if you bought it).I think that's why more mobile gamers play it..like most of my friends quit CODM for it..so I think CODM can fix this.!(I mean there's nothing to fix..ya kn wht I mean).,4
Game is superb. I am enjoying to deal with this game. Still there are some issues like while the game is running your mic suddenly stops working. Sometimes also the screen goes black and one of the biggest issue is that we can't take loot from airdrops when it is in water. Note: In season 7 the worst most thing is that we cannot play hardpoint in map like Tunisia. Plz make this map available in all modes.,4
"I love this game more than the console games. I changed from 5 to 4 stars because of bugs. The longer I stay alive in BR the more likey my game will freeze or loop,(1 out of 3 matches.) I understand this is a big map with alot of players per server but please fix. Using a Note 10+ on fiber optic wifi.",4
From when I have updated to season 7 when I open the game and go to the spin(in which we can get Captain - green lime) when I tap to watch video it shows that I have watched enough video but I did't watched any from when I have updated the game (Thursday). Please check watch what had happened to my game account is INS12(2.0) I had login from Facebook,4
"Been playing non stop since Feb. There aren't really any downsides apart from being penalized if you don't do well in battle royale, which isn't always your fault. I once had a team mate who glitched into the floor. This is very rare though. Great game otherwise.",4
This game is one of the best mobile shooting games that I've ever played. Now this part is for the people that made the game I love this game but the reason it's not a 5 star rated is because of the cod points I wish you could at least win enough to get stuff but you can only buy them. Can your COD team at least make some challenges to get cod points,4
"Really good game in season 6 there was some errors are in battle royale but in season 7 all bugs are fixed, the cod team works on it i'm very thankful for them ,but 1 star i have reduced for this game because there is some issue for playing lucky draw game ,videos for free coins are unavailable so please fixx this otherwpise the game is really good 😊😊",4
"Best first person shooter game ive played yet by far, love this game!! Only thing i dont understand is sometimes i will unload almost a whole clip into an enemy and they will turn and shoot me twice and im the one that gets killed. Not sure if its sopposed to be that way but dosnt seem fair. Other than that four thumbs up👍👍👍👍",4
"My experience overall is good but when it comes to the comms in game they don't work. In the lobby we can talk properly with no problems but once in-game comms dissappear, sometimes you hear your teammates then it's back to no comms. Audio and Mic will be on but nothing works. And this is a major problem cause when playing with a team or group of friends the communication is key and especially with the upcoming tournament. Please fix this audio issue",4
"This is the second time I report this same issue and nothing has been fixed or corrected. On on 1 of last last seasons premium battle crates I was awarded an XPR1 Geometry that never made it to my loadout. I paid real money for the prem battle pass and got it again because I'm a huge and old fan of the game. Used to purchase these games on my Xbox360. Please correct, it's only fair. Now there's another bug that's driving me crazy; I've been completing daily missions but dont receive points, fix",4
It's a really fun game and they have some ok free to play items but to really get anything good u gotta spend like 100 dollars worth cod points in order to even come close to getting something cool. But really this is an awesome game I do suggest it to everyone they are starting to add some cool stuff to grind for and they are adding new maps every month and everything it's just flat out a good game. Nice job to everyone who worked on and still continues to bring cool things to the game!,4
"I'm a free to play-player, and that being said, I'm really sad that the ""CP"" currency, is only obtained by buying it, y'all could give 1 CP each day if that's a good idea for y'all, maybe you can turn 5,000 C into 1 CP, if y'all want, a good idea is: '1 CP per ad!!' I'm just really dissatisfied that you can get such amazing stuff for 10 CP but you can only get a glittery textured gun skin for 20,000C. Thank you",4
"I love this game, it reminds me of the good old days, I just wish that getting legendary weapons was easier, while playing for the past few seasons I fell in love with the effects, my only problem is that I spent over $200 to get 1 legendary weapon, I think we should be able to convert our credits into cod points, or make the drop rate for them larger.",4
Everything is correct in this game except a mode which is Ranked match. The remaining part of the game is wonderful. Anyways the practice vs AI is a very fascinating mode which allows us to relax AFTER LOSING CONSECUTIVE RANKED MATCHES WHERE TEAMMATES ARE NOT SO SKILLED AS EXPECTED. The only solution for anger control after LOSING A RANKED MATCH is to practice vs AI which ensures you a sure win.,4
"..still being cut off when I have a full connection !.very tempted to spend money on this game as a believe payers get preferential treatment...also you can use a Bluetooth controller,which I don't have on my "" Mobile phone "" !.Sony,strike again...if I could link my phone to a PS, I would buy another..",4
"CodM definetely one of the best if not the best shooting multiplayer game, lots of modes and definitely f2p friendly and makes being a p2w player worth while as well with all the cool skins for characters and guns. I gave 4 stars because the ranking system in rank mode specifically ranked in mp is pretty flawed. The main thing I hate is how you get points taken away when you lose, theres events every new moon where it locks your points but i think not deducting points should be the norm.",4
"In my opinion, this is the best game in the playstore... i would put it at 5 stars only if the game wasnt so laggy. when i play the game, it lags CONSTANTLY and it ruins my experience so good to the point where i just watch other people play it, i would spend more money on this game if i could play it more often. I love the cod series as it is but playing this for as laggy as it is, kinda makes me sad about it. Please fix the lag and i bet more people will play if they aren't already.",4
Please fix this problem to make the gaming experience more better.My battle royale doesn't work While playing br suddenly my device restarts. This also happens for multiplayer. Also sometimes the screen turns black randomly. Plus the screen gets stuck on loading please be patient 37 percent. Activision we have high Hopes on you.,4
"Such a fun and addictive game with loads of different playable modes. Has great graphics, gameplay and controls. The only place this game is pretty lackluster is in the payment department. Only supporting Gpay which supports a mere 29 countries compared to something like PayPal which supports over a whopping 200 countries across the globe. Fortnite supports PayPal which is a huge win for me. So 4 stars is it I guess. Thank you",4
"The only game I enjoy that's mobile, but I need the zombie mode!!! It literally is the biggest tease... I didn't get to play the zombie mode before it got taken down so it's just there in the HUD screen looking all exciting without a clue of when it's coming back.. bring the ZOMBIES back and I'll leave the rate at a 5👌",4
it's the best shooter I've ever played but on my galaxy a71 there is a bug in the battle royal mode the screen turn to black one or twice a match so I can't play battle royal I hope you fix it with an update I wonder because the voice is ok just screen turn to black so I loose every match I get 5 star if you fix the problem thanks for care and support bye.,4
"Its a nice game, its enjoyable, its fun. A lot of shooting, so there's that. Plus, there are a lot of missions and a lot of prices to win. You advance through the levels pretty quickly, and upgrading the weapons is no sweat at all. It is my most FAVORITE mobile game as of right now.",4
The game is just awesome but the only issue i face is when i play battle royale. The game won't even let me move smoothly in the map it gets frame lag and the screen becomes frozen but im able to hear the audio but then if i try to restart the game after i enter the match the screen gets frozen this was not an issue until May when the Season 6 came. I love the battle royale for this game but it doesn't get the same love from the CODM officials . They need to optimise the game properly for us.,4
"Fix your damn spawns in ffa, they are horrible. Fix the matchmaking in ranked because I get in a team with noobs me carrying them and the other team is full pros and sweats. The settings that make shoot automaticly is too op and noobs use it a lot. The probelms I just mentioned are not that good but they get annoying at times. Everything else is amazing Thank you",4
"playing the game with uncalled for lag that is not because of my network or signal, spawning with the other team and not being able to kill them but dying myself, hearing the other teams' announcements, screen ""randomly"" goes black but I am still in game, players turning invisible, sometimes my weapon will aim but not fire (not using controller), etc... These are things that can be fixed. I will edit my review if they do get fixed.",4
"ACTIVISION I just love you for this amazing game. The only problem I experienced was the battle royale blackout issue, although I got it the first time sice I started playing the game 6 months ago. Still the new update has some problems and my free lucky draw is freezed. Please solve the problem .Hoping to see improvements and bug fixes in season 8..... It would be great if a optional downloadable campaign mode was there like other call of duty titles too.....",4
I love all about this game that's why I bought BP. I've been playing this since last year but recently my app just turn black and crashing all of a sudden in the middle of game especially at BR causing me to lose some battles. Please fix the bugs to make our money and time worth.,4
I have encountered a glitch in which my profile pic doesn't change in the game even if I changed it in facebook. I logged out and in several times but the issue persisted. Please see. Great game. I love everything about it. It's improving with every update.,4
"Everything is good, but the only problem is with the mic. Even when I turn it on my teammates can't hear me and when I turn off and on the permission for mic it still doesnt work. I request Call Of Duty Mobile to see in this matter and fix the mic bug.",4
"This game is a solid 1st person shooter, especially considering it's on mobile. Yes, it's pay-to-win, yes, the balance is off, yes, no-one uses the in-game team chat, but it's awesome regardless. I recommend if you have a Bluetooth Controller or a PS4/Xbox One Controller, Pair it to your phone, turn on the option in the game's settings, put the sensitivity on high, and play. It's absolutely 100 times better, it feels natural, and it's massive improvement to the on-screen controls you get.",4
"I love this game, although... I wish there was a button to press when you want to shoot instead of just aiming on the enemy and the gun shoots itself. But other than that I love this game and I think you should download this now! (Unless your not allowed to play gun games)",4
"Overall game is good and multiplayer mode is just awesome. But you need to improvement in Battle royal mode graphic, Control and movements. Fix your mic glitch also..... My friends and me also can't hear each other sounds and the mic show some errors. So please fix it as soon as possible.",4
"I love the game, but the new update has a lot of bugs, especially voice chat. We cant hear the opposite team despite being on the friend channel while playing private matches. Please fix them asap so that we can enjoy the new season tyvm Also please add ""Free For All"" as a core game mode.",4
Remember me before I was pretty rude but now that I reinstalled the game it actually works now yay what's the one of the pictures for your game has to do with the zombies mode I wish you'd bring it back because I want to see what it was like it was like and plus I don't think there's a such thing as a good Zombies mode. ( the mode was attack of the undead by the way I forgot about that) there's a thing for zombies but it's not a thing anymore what's up with that,4
I love this game . But giving 4 stars because still with season 7 we didn't get any new map in battle royale mode. Although we have major update on old map. But still map is same just some new zones are added. I will give 5 stars to this game when we got some new maps in battle royale mode.,4
The game isn't accepting my payments for purchasing battle passes and it's filled with bugs with the latest update. The voice chat has been buggy and the game crashes out. Would have given 5stars because I'm a longtime player of COD but these are done issues which are really putting me off the mobile version.,4
"Originally I would've rated it 5 stars because it is the best mobile game ever... But recently the game has become buggy, maybe because of server overload, and the recent upgrade hasn't helped much. However, it's still the best mobile game ever.",4
"For 6 seasons this game has been running so well on my device, and now season 7 I've been getting lag spikes like crazy, the server lag is terrible and it's so sad to see my favourite game go down this path of where every update it gets harder and harder to run on devices such as mine. I'm heartbroken😔",4
Best game to be played but takes very much space Thank you,4
It was all good till season 5 but now it keeps crashing and black screen on majority android 10 devices please fix it quick before tournament stage 2 comes.,4
Nice game 👌👍 the graphics are good and everything thing else is good,4
"I mean, I love this game it's very fun but for some reason it just won't redownload.",4
Slightly there is a lag on the opening of the game pls try to improve it,4
Amazing awesome gameplay and excellent graphics,4
"Great Game to play, would like to see more options for different maps like airports, skylines to make game scenarios more interesting",4
"Very good game,all time this game play",4
Game is good but no noooob players should play with pro players please because it causes a great problem for pro players in winning,4
"Game is good but sense the update there has been lots of bugs I've found, 1: on the main screen there will be a second player model T posing in the background facing backwards, 2: every time I enter multiplayer some music will just start playing and I don't know how to turn it off even though I have the Music option turned off in settings it will just continue non stop unless if I close the game, 3: game will often crash causing so much lag that I have to close the game and lose Ranked Points",4
Bit laggy when Im playing,4
GoodGame...Please put Erangel map also on battle royal...,4
Update: definite performance improvements. So far so good.,4
"Awesome! , But sever problem",4
The game is very fun and has great graphics and support. Please take out search and destroy from ranked. It's the worst game mode in the game and 95% of players will agree. It's not fun especially when you have a team getting their ass whooped by the enemies. Bring demolition and make that ranked as it would be way more competitive and fun.,4
Thik thak ha,4
They deleted zombies >:( .... multiplayer is fun.... fw it tho,4
Ok,4
It's a nice game but takes a lot of data to download,4
Please remove bug so i give 4stars,4
The game is extremely good but ply fix the lag in the battleroyale mode .,4
Call of duty mobile is dope af if you don't have it you're trash Haha,4
"After the last update, mic was not working properly.. as we can't communicate with squad..",4
It's fun but needs a story mode,4
Good awesome gameplay and excellent graphics,4
Nice game 👍👍👍👌👍😎,4
This game is awesome 👌👌👌 It is on the forth number on the world's best games Just a little laggy and stuff,4
Only problem is that the update is always big not every has wifi not even pubg gameplay is awesome this big,4
The game is so good very good graphics i love the new map expansión and the new battle pass but what i think it will make better is a campaing a story line,4
"In a game this big, you cannot expect NO BUGS! The game is good but saying it the best doesnot suit. I like the game though!",4
"Good game , enjoying a lot while playing, but i think there should be some clips of previously played games, to know the faults and learn some new strategies. Atleast for half of a day or for 24 hrs. It should be availbale to watch.",4
"Activision, i beg you in the name of God, remove ""tanks"" from BR, or level the playing field, with c4 or the Javelin like in mw4",4
Pooping the same time as well,4
Godd game but bring back zombies and make a dereisendrache zombie map please,4
Great game play.,4
Good graphics Nice game But no characters And i also didn't liked the maps thaf much So 4 stars,4
"I liked the game very much at the beginning, I waited so long that the battle royal was more than 2 maps, and this game has no salt for me",4
Better than free fire or hopless land but not better than pubg 1) good graphic 2)very high storage 😿😿,4
I really like the game but the quallity is low,4
Great game awesome gameplay and excellent graphics,4
"Its a great time killer especially with friends, feels just like the console version but with minor differences, the only take away is that in BR chat seems to be a bit iffy hopefully they can improve in the chat department for a better communication with friends.",4
Forever to download.....,4
Its all good but I can't use my wireless controller [uses USB but is wireless] plz fix this,4
The BR mode is very nice but also needs a finishing touch The MR mode is the best and is really fun to play.,4
They have improved the game a lot. awesome gameplay and excellent graphics,4
Why not add a Hardcore mode.,4
The game was good but it was lacking too much. When i was always lacking the game. The game took too much data. Too much data problem 😠😠😠😠😠,4
The Game Is Absolutely Amazing At Season 7 Minor Issues But It's Great,4
Best shooting game ever.,4
Bekar ha aaathu,4
good game love it ...thou improve on shooting skills,4
Good awesome gameplay and excellent graphics,4
It was good but without friends is good The zombies in battle royals is good Upgrade the vehicles and its control Get skins like fortnite,4
"Can you guys add ""ground war"" mode or ""conquest"" mode like battlefield in codm?????",4
It is good game y'all give the best updated i miss the zambie i like the pics story new mape on battel match y'all did put flying ship that cool and the tank that supper cool i like that,4
Everytime i play one shot one kill its freezes and then boots my whole phone off to restart,4
I know my phone probably just sucks but this game takes up so much space and that is why I gave a 4 star review and 5 the gameplay is fun the chat is mostly nice to new players and graphics are not good.👍,4
Good 😎,4
How do I change my region so I can join my mates in the competition I'm in the same region as them but mine says other for some reason,4
"Its very difficult to indicate direction in map of this game,add some map indicator functions",4
Amazing awesome gameplay and excellent graphics,4
"Splendid Though it alots a huge space, graphics and gameplay in every mode is outstanding..",4
It's a fun game and has decent modes but has glitches such as random screen flipping and a music glitch that plays music louder than other sounds that also cant be muted (might be caused by headphones) it also doesn't appear to be music ever used in the game,4
"Awesome game really fun to play. Make this game more enjoyable, add features from Cod war zone.",4
It's good but the man of war is so good,4
Good awesome gameplay and excellent graphics,4
i play b.force and b.ops and pubG call of duty is better than those games but i rate 4 star i think sometimes free CP coin make the game better (i know about championship cp) also thanks for your good game,4
Fix Microphone access error !!,4
The game is good but the problem is. Here is not story mode that i want and many players want . Battle Royal is not interesting but you should add story mode like (COD WW2) that type of modewe need. And please improve battle Royal mode and please add story mode that. Will be amazing to play story mode free in mobile with good grafix,4
nice experience awesome gameplay and excellent graphics,4
"It's a great game, but there is a lot of bots. I also had a glitch where I couldn't get into the app and the screen was just blank white.",4
Multiplayer mode was awesome but battle royale was very very sucks and worst please fix graphics like pubg,4
"It's a fun game , every one must try it.",4
I loved it the best game ever even that there is a probleme in the voice chat Thank you,4
Very good but automatic aim is very annoying,4
Challenging but needs more broader maps,4
 awesome gameplay and excellent graphics  Prolly the best game for mobile right now,4
After lasr updation it just started Lagging.... 😐😐😐😐😐 Thank you,4
"Too many manoeuvers need to be done after the match finishes, before one can land on the main screen.",4
It's a great game... But it seems like I can't move around seemingly anymore 😢.. I just gets back to the same position I was in😔,4
"It's so awesome, but the lagging is too much. There is always space for improvement, they should also improve the map graphics a little bit.",4
Ok good but real cod modern warfare needs private battle royales,4
The best game ever played my friend and me are playing every time every one should play call of duty,4
"COD, the best game ever. ..",4
I love this game 💕 and I hope you fix the server 🤙,4
"This is an overall good game but where Activision went wrong was removing zombie mode, they should've removed battle royale instead cuz COD is actually famous for it's multiplayer's anyway I hope COD will rethink this and consider my opinion",4
This game is excitingly good. But I am facing a small issue that I should say to you...this game sometimes suddenly closes itself when I was playing a battle royale match it is very annoying ..so this my humble request to solve this problem or tell me something so that I can solve this problem myself.please solve this problem so I can give five stars,4
Hii my cod is not working.. whenever I try to enter in cod it's like error something by playstore.. something like network problem...,4
I kove COD but please bring back zombie mode too I just love the option where you want have three different game mode!,4
"The game is great, multiple game modes and captivating weapons and skins. My qualm is just controller player balancing, it appears that at least one is allowed on each team but a majority of players will still have a significant advantage over mobile. Matches can be taken over when they pick players off early and earn scorestreaks. Recoil management while aiming farther seems a lot easier. Can something be done here? Can offline play also be added, potentially for bots, like the console games?",4
Good graphic awesome gameplay and excellent graphics,4
Still lagging battle royal,4
Plz make ranked skilled based plz,4
Very good game awesome gameplay and excellent graphics Thank you,4
It is a good game but it takes along time to install and update every time I try to update it first try as it is almost done it stops and I have to restart the proccess so I will give it 4 stars but the controls and everything is perfect,4
 awesome gameplay and excellent graphics  Good game,4
Every time in BR game crash,4
It's a good game but it's battle royal is not so large and it have to bring some more weapons and new modes,4
fix matchmaking Constant tdm and s&d this season,4
"PLEASE go back to last season's battle pass where you got an item every rank increase whether or not you paid for premium. Also, there is a bug where if you delete friends, they still count towards your friend total, so you can't add more even if you are clearly under the limit. I am at 5, I once was at 10, and I can't add any more friends. Other than that, I like it. It's a great game and player skill balances most issues between players paying for premium or not.",5
"Great game!! Love playing and the experience only gets better with each new modification. Though there are some areas I'm not sure why are there if you can't do anything with. Such as the Weaponset of the character select. I get the backpack and stuff. But I have yet to been able to set each character with their own weaponset. Also, what about helmet? Same there. Are they interchangeable? Some clarity would be great! And if they aren't of any use, can it be removed?",5
"I would give this game 20/20 if I could. This is the best FPS game i have ever played. The graphics are awesome, the weapons are incredible. The Multi-player and Battle Royal Mode are Booooooom. Except the fact that i couldn't add some certain friends because it's not updated, and it's more than 2Gb. Can't keep updating that, it's too much. But i still love it anyways. Thank you",5
"I love the game. We are the beta testers for the gameplay is awesome if you are having problems email them the issues so they can fix them all new things can be improved. For yall that are experiencing lag is probably the phone you have or your service. You always want just a little better than the minimum requirements. For people like me with great service and a really nice phone if you lag on battle royal or MP its more than likely due to hackers, hacking causes lag. I hope this helps. Enjoy the game.",5
"Before the update playing in Battle Royale was awesome. It still would be if i could actually stay in the game. It keeps shutting off on me about 2 minutes in the game. Idk why this is happening but would like to if anyone else was experiencing the same. Can someone help me? Reguardless of my issue i still rate it 5 stars. I tried to but i cant live without it. So please, someone help me. I think i'll die if i dont fix this.",5
"I bet this is the best mobile game on the planet. This game is amazing. But this game freezes and lags a lot while playing. The lagging problem is frequent while playing battle royale. The developers should fix this big issue as soon as possible. I have been reporting this issue from a month, but there is no solution. Please fix this please.",5
"This is probably one of the best games on the app store. This has me absolutely drawn in with its different game modes. Not only is there classic match making variations but also battle royal, ranked, and zombies! Lots of content to explore. Lots custom control options. Match making seems balanced so far. This is a fine example of the standards that the future of mobile games should employ! Bravo 10/10.",5
"This is an excellent game. No lag, the only issue I have rarely encountered is that it suddenly closes the app. But other than that the game runs smoothly, the graphics are amazing, the gameplay is fantastic. Different game modes are great. Very very addictive game. Play for a minute end up playing hours. It's just a very fun game to play and personally it is one of the best mobile games I have ever played. Thank you",5
"This game is so fun and addictive more than any other FPS games. I had so much fun on multiplayer, ranked match, battle royal, I don't know which is my favorite but I do want to go back to finish off the undead. I even made a lot of friends in this game! I had no idea I made a lot plus I would always go back to this game just for more prizes and to finish the objective on featured. This is so far my favorite game. Thank you Activation, Infinity Ward, Timi studio, Tencent games, and all the other",5
"Fantastic game. I have never played a call of duty title before and I was surprised how enjoyable this game is. Graphics are spectacular and look decent on less powerful devices which is super. There is plenty of in game content with new seasons every month, new weapons, maps, modes, scorestreaks and operator skills. Controls aren't one of the strong points for the game but they're useable which is just so so. Overall this game is fantastic in almost every way and I definitely recommend.",5
"Truly exceptional. Really does a great job at bringing Cod's traditional gameplay on the go. Controls are fully customisable and it overall runs well on many devices. In the mobile business, the Multiplayer is probably the best, and the Battle Royale is up there with the rest. Great game, lot's of fun. Highly recommend it to both new players to the genre, aswell as competitive players.",5
"Very fun and addictive. If you like call of duty and want to play on the go or don't feel like sitting in front of the console, this is a great way to get your fix. Has maps from previous games. Weapon loadouts are great and easy to use with new skins and weapons able to earn and /or purchase. Everything you'd need in a Call of Duty mobile game!",5
Excellent game!!!!!!! If you love COD on your favorite consol then this is a must play. The great thing is you dont have to spend money to advance. But it does make things pretty dang cool if you do lol. I have played alot of games on mobile and i end up deleting them not long after acouple days getting bored. But they done an outstanding job with this on mobile. If i could rate 10 stars this game would have it for sure. Cant wait to see what else they have in store for us later on. Love it!!!!,5
"After six months, this is one of the best mobile FPS games out there. Although controls can be a bit clunky at first, you eventually get used to them for some good Call of Duty fun. The gameplay is highly engaging and the graphics are amazing for a mobile game. In-app purchases don't affect the gameplay at all as they only exist for unlocking cosmetics. Highly recommended.",5
"Awesome game, keeps me entertained for awhile when it doesnt glitch and I'm basically running in place. Uninstalled and reinstalled like twice now and it's still doing this. Please fix asap!! Edit: Holy hell guys, you did a fantastic job!! This game is smooth and the update was everything I needed. Timing couldn't be more perfect. It's my getaway for sure and I appreciate the improvements!!",5
"Wow! Love this game on mobile. I was addicted to gaming during my college years and decided to quit consoles as it was affecting my work life. I can monitor my game use on my phone so it helps me stay within range. The modes are amazing except for Battle Royale lol. I would suggest that parents pay attention to what's said in the chat rooms. I report chats w/ ""jokes"" about underage sex or racism. The company should also update their FAQ's and link to a glossary. Thank you",5
"Great game, actually I have stopped playing any other game because of this. Everything is perfect, graphics to gameplay. This season battle pass is useless, I must say that. You told us about a more military based experience, not this characters which looks like cleaners. We need ""Soldiers"", that is the main idea which comes to your mind when you hear ""Call of Duty"". Continue changing your ways of like, and you will be loosing fans gradually.",5
Only issue I have is the pairing of players. The game puts beginners (say a level 9) in with far more experienced players (say lvl 130). There should be a cap on the ranges playing on a team or against each team so no one plays 15 to 20 levels higher than where they are in development. This allows them to get better but not overly discouraged. Thank you,5
"I've been a COD fan for a long time. Being used to the PC, I was skeptical about the mobile interface. I was good at pubg too. Something about this game was really addictive. Could be the fact that it was COD or could just be the comfortable user experience. Whatever the reason, I'm hooked onto this game. I play multiplayer more than Battle Royale which is due to my love for fast game play. The lag issues and stability seem to be improving day by day too. This is a really good game. Love it.",5
Amazing game. Intense and Immersive game play. Although I only have a few complaints regarding the game play. Vehicles need work. Probably the most clunky part of the game. Makes Pubgm driving feel like heaven. Audio needs work as you may already know. And most definitely my biggest gripe of all is the world chat. You absolutely need moderators. I've never seen a more toxic and racist chat in my life. Trolling and trash talking is all apart the culture for sure but damn. We need mods asap.,5
"The gameplay is fluid, awesomely optimised for mobile devices. The action and gunplay is exhilarating yet smooth combined with just the right amount of pace in movement, for fights and for roaming. I personally favour the multiplayer modes it's fast and crisp, with numerous modes and events and maps. Love the controls, this is by far the best control experience in a shooter for me. It's smooth, easy to cope for beginners, swift and extremely responsive, fully customizable.",5
"What can I say, this game is goodass! I don't know a whole lot of the gameplay yet but I will, and when I get it down, watch out, your ass is mine! This is the only online game I would have given up five. The only other game I would have given all five points too, was war wings. This game equals that, at least. That's saying a whole lot! I will continue to learn this game get better and better, and continue to kick your asses..... This is a goodass game, come get some, motherfukers!!!!!!!",5
"I was reluctant to try this after playing warfare/warzone on pc... But God damn did they do a good job on this game. I don't typically like mobile games since they are a bit too cartoony and 2d for me. But this is excellent! They have included numerous maps from the pc console version, along with guns and gaming modes. I have been playing with a ps4 controller and haven't found anything I dislike, it's just plain fun and runs smooth! Good job Devs. Thank you",5
"If you like COD, modern warfare, black ops. Infinite warfare, any of them, you'll like this. Its damn near just like those games, except its mobile. Like any other game you can spend money to get better stuff, but its not needed, I never have and I smack up the people who do spend money on the game! They update it often too so new maps, modes, scenarios etc are updated and changing. 1 vs 1, 2 vs 2, battle royal, gun game, one shot one kill, etc etc. If you dont have this game, then your loss.",5
"This game is just helarious. I am playing this game for alot of time. And I am on level 75. It is just enough for me. It's better than PUBG. I wish I can give it a GOOGOL stars. The thing you can improve is when I try to kill a guy with out scopeing in, he or she dies after some time. And when I try to kill a guy with scopeing in he or she dies in couple of seconds. So, pls improve it.",5
"Amazing! If I can give this a 100 stars I would, I'm very impressed in this game very well made. [Edit] Last year, when I wrote this and I said that I was disappointed on the Battle Royale mode since it was laggy and buggy for me atleast. Right now the developers have impressed me, it improved so much than the last one. I just want to give a quick thanks to the developers, thanks for fixing this! I am now able to play the Battle Royale mode, not just me but also with my friends! Thanks again! :)",5
Cod mobile is the best game in the playstore. I pay for seasons. I play as much as I can. Great for playing with friends. A bit of a toxic community and voice chat has some serious issues. But we easily conference call during gameplay. So excited to lay $9 for the new season. Plus the developers are aware of curre t events and have used their platform to help marginalized communities (pretty minimal but still) i will rerate the game if i see fit but its 5 out of 5 for me. Love it.,5
"Hi, I'm big fan of your games and I have 3 suggestions that can make the game more enjoyable 1- I'll talk about BR mode & the addition of tanks is AWESOME 😍 just increase the number of TANKS. 2- (please this point is very important) add a new class, named it ""engineer man"" and all his job is to fix the tank (or any vehicle) when get damaged. 3- add the SCORESTREAKS to the BR mode that's will be wonderful, like if i kill 5 enemy i can call AirStreak and hit the tank or something like that.",5
Probably one of the few mobile games I am willing to play (I'm a PC and console player). This game is fun and doesn't force me to pay for anything. It doesn't have any pay to win items to pay for unlike games like RAID. I rarely play mobile games since most bait players into paying more money but this game doesn't and the gameplay is 5/5. Lastly the gamepad support is icing on the cake.,5
"Amazing game I don't really gave any complaints. The game only runs generally good and choppy for me because my phone is low-end. (Something like super low graphics or a low-end performance mode would be incredible) All I really wish that was different was the classic queuing system like BO2, MW3, etc... as well as prestige. Most people are already level 150 and there isn't much to do or get once you're at that level.",5
"The game sometimes suddenly kicks me out of the app in the middle of the game and then I have to open the app again to find myself in the middle of the battle and killed, please fix this error،the new update voice chat is horrible and always off this is huge f***** issue in the update you need to fix it asap, and am sorry but season 7 so far its like a s***",5
"This game is too awesome! Everything about it:from its graphics to its features,events and all, its just perfect. I am totally in love with this game💕Every season update just give the game a glow and makes it better and better. Even though am a girl, I like this game too much. It's better than pubg and any other game🥀",5
Everything is excellent but the game must expand its airplane line from where it starts. Due to this we can reach at our respective destination. I am still trying to reach at my destination because the airplane goes only at a certain distance. So please just extend the distance for airplane till the end of map... Overall Everything is excellent Thank you,5
"Would not have thought a game of this quality could be possible on a mobile phone, I think it's the best app I have ever installed. This is coming from a person born in 77 who has grown up with the most basic of CPU's and gaming consoles. Well done team, Very impressive and thank you For making it possible Cheers..... :)",5
"This game is by far the absolute best game I've ever played on a mobile device and come on, to top it off it's free. you can buy things in the game if you want but at the same time if you don't want to you can still kick ass just like anybody else. by far number one in my book keep it like it is it's perfect. Keep up the good work it is truly just like I'm playing it on Playstation or Xboxit it was exactly what I was looking for. Its just like playing the game. I love it... tx",5
"Love this game. 5 stars from me, now theres always room for improvement but these guys post gameplay is awesome pretty consistantly always fixing bugs and what not. Gameplay for me is smooth and the game is fair no need to pay to win or worry about not having the best guns. Only thing different is the paints all stats on them are the same so if you pay its just really for cosmetics. Thank you",5
"Hey COD Mobile®. This gaming experience has been tremendously awesome so far. However, for some reason after I updated the game to Season 7, it keeps crashing at the loading screen. I'd really like to enjoy the new update just as everyone else is. I really love this game and would appreciate if fixations would be made if possible.",5
This game is epic. The versatility of the gaming experience is what makes this game an easy pick above all of the other 1st person shooters on the market available today. I highly recommend this game to anyone to play regardless of their experience in FPS video games. I look forward to seeing how this game evolves in the future. Thank you,5
"Fantastic game, certainly made covid-19 at home bearable especially when my android phone accepts the ps4 wireless controller, the experience is like playing on console but limited as it's a mobile phone, the new update is here, season 7, so i shall see if it's any good to continue. I use a OnePlus 7t and the gaming speed and graphics is immensely satisfying, I'd say it's better than the Samsung and Apple platforo.",5
"A great way to pass the time, Call of Duty Mobile provides a good balance of quality and gameplay as well as the ability to customize your soldier and their items. I've had this game for three weeks and it's very good. I would recommend this game to anyone who always wanted to play CoD or those who've played it online or on a gaming console, but more of a mobile experience.",5
"The game is good but the only weapons you will use are the smgs and snipers. The smgs are better than almost every single assault rifle in fire rate and damage. Compare the m4 and the ak74u, the ak74u is more accurate, has the same range, more fire rate and damage. This is why smgs outclass every other weapon in every fire fight in mid to close range which the majority of your fights are. The m16 also needs a buff because how pathetic it is now.",5
This game has been one of my stress busters during this lockdown period and quite frankly I always was a big fan of COD since childhood and having to play the same on our handheld device has been a phenomenal experience.... There are some glitches in the game play but it is a software we are talking and this will only get better with time.... Excited for season 7...Kudos to the developers for working rigorously on improving this game..,5
"I honestly don't know where to start but first of all the graphics are so good and i've never seen a mobile game like this. The preformence is so good and there is no lagg and i love that there is a feature that makes u choose Low, Medium or High preformence, i like this feature beacuse everybody got diffrent phones and diffrent limits. Thank you",5
I have have given update of season 7 but after that it is not opening ........they are saying that I have a good network connection.......but really I have a strong network connection.........and then they are saying that if I can't solve this problem then should go to the personal or official page.....now anyone can please say me what is personal or official page of call of duty???,5
"Holy smokes...this game just got so much better. I was getting pretty bored up until season 7 but please fix the lag issue. I'm running 90+ Mbps sitting right next to router and still lag every now and then ( 3 to 4 occasions per battle) but it only takes 1 to be killed. Is there anyway you guys can have the graphics and frame rate automatically adjust to prevent lagging? Other than that, awesome game. I can only assume it'll get better and better. Like Hammer says ""can't touch this"" 👍",5
"Season 7 : #1 app in the segment 🥳 Woah 🤩 I mean its really growing and the new update is just wow! Yeah now I can say the new map is neither less than any other games in the segment, it can now compete with any of #1 game and if someone prefers the quality, can surely go for it!! The tech is amazing and the team working on it is been performing exceptionally outstanding 🙌 awesome ✨",5
"I honestly love the game!!! I never realized how much effort and work tencent and Activision have done. It's like I like my household gaming console but when it comes down to this mobile gaming. I'm in love! I wish the Warfare could get different maps, but I ain't complaining much. I went from PUBG to THIS!!!",5
"If you loved BO2 or MW2-3 multi then you'll enjoy the mobile version. Matches are quick to join and controls are responsive. Graphics are good and easily tuned to your device. I've been spending more time on Cod-M than Warzone just due to being able to jump into a BR in less than 30sec. If you have a half decent PC, use GameLoop. It's the official PC emulator.",5
"Very well built mobile shooter, in BR the sniping needs a slight fix, I'd like too see them one hit on head shots not just the legendary one, I'd like too see thermals on more weapons then just the 50cal, a 1.5 thermal for ARs, SMG, LMG would rock. Also would love too see a BR based on 2 teams of 50 each, 1 team defending (with gas masks) a set of targets say 4-8 for x amount of time, while the other team assaults them trying too destroy them,game ends if all are destroyed or circle closes.",5
"I think this is a great game, many gaming options in multilayer and I really enjoy the BR, the map is vast and it's fun game play, i would like more skins and characters for those who choose not to purchase the battle pass and just the annoying little bug problems but patches are available for them most of the time. awesome gameplay and excellent graphics Thank you",5
"The graphics are awesome the lobby has to be the best I've ever seen in any game and even the sound effects are flawless especially the update made it even better overall this game is the best I've been playing it for 4months now and it's never felt boring but if it would've taken lesser storage space it could've been better but still you can't leave it,youll get connected to the game",5
This game is awesome. Its truly just like the version on ps3 and game quality and controls are bang on aside from the issue earlier mentioned with the left side shoot button dragging left analog up to sprint. The one thing that's got to me about the game is the fact you brought zombies survival out n it was so much fun. But now theres no zombies but still an option to have a zombies load out wich is just rubbing it in our face that once upon a time we could play zombies. Bring it back 4good plz,5
"Overall Great Experience, beautiful graphics for a mobile game and exceptionally good gameplay, only con to this game is how addictive it is! Free rewards bring in a whole new level of fun challenges to complete, theres always something to keep players happy! The Cod mobile team and community are always bringing great additions to the game!",5
All that will top this is if they some how reduce the input lag for all Bluetooth controllers i would like to see switch controllers supported. And if we could hide our mobile HUD when using controllers. For BR Mode i Absolutely like it just a few Suggestions. If we could pull out our Parachute Similar to warzone that would be nice Other then that the best Mobile game yet. Even without using a controller. This just feels Right!!! Thank you,5
"The game is too good. But i was trying to join the beta version for so many days but it only showes the pricess will take some time and it remain the same. It's so frustrating. The accuracy of aim and shoot is needed to be updated. It doesn’t matter if the bullet hit the body or not, they die. awesome gameplay and excellent graphics Thank you",5
This is my favourite game of all time. I thought that pubg was better. But with this app it has what pubg has and more. It's like pubg but way better. Battle royals is so fun. For a while after playing it it becomes boring but there is the new update to play in rust that is so much fun after you play battle royale. I want zombies back. Me and my family would kill to have zombies. So to the creator of cod please bring back zombies. I wanna play it please 💙,5
"This was one of the most fabulous games I have ever played , I would support codm over pubg mobile I have been playing cod since pre season , it has made a lot of improvement in gameplay , new modes new maps it is just amazing seeing a game go from pre season to season 7 . Well them timi gaming well done Tencent gaming for making such a fabulous game , I would love more gameplay is awesome and tournament , thanks for this amazing game.",5
Excellent game as long as it stays way it is and they don't change it. Game issues with accounts do need to be sorted though as game randomly signs me out of my account when I disconnect due to latency and loose xp and gain match penalty through it. Also people cheating and taking advantage of game like spawn trap killing needs to be sorted. Other than that I give it a 5 star for now but if things change rating goes down,5
"Best shooting game I have ever played . Graphics are awesome , all the modes are cool , loadout has many guns and mind-blowing skins . Really love the game . But I just have one problem...during a hard point multiplayer or a battle royale it doesn't show the points obtained by both teams and the number of players alive .",5
"I just downloaded this yesterday. I am using a Samsung Galaxy a10 from metro and I have not experienced any lagging or any other types of bugs with the operating system. This is one of the best shooters I've ever played on a cell phone. I highly reccomend downloading , see you on the battlefield… awesome gameplay and excellent graphics",5
"This game blows all other mobile apps out of the water, I recently figured out how to get my ps4 controller connected to my phone (hoping for the ability to menu without touching my phone, but doesnt hurt the gameplay) and I couldn't tell you the difference between this and the cod I used to play, a hit of nostalgia in every map!",5
Awesome game.....the controls are very smooth....the graphics is superb.....the Multiplayer mode is great.....but when playing battle royale the screen simply becomes black in the middle of the game and can do nothing on the screen.....and have to restart the game....I request the COD Mobile team to fix this issue....I love playing this game…. Thank you,5
Just beyond all expectations! Just awesome. And it keeps getting better each season. Love it! Second to none! Guaranteed! And now with the newest update??? Forget about it because no other game out there offers half as much as CALL OF DUTY MOBILE. Can't say enough good.,5
Awesome controls and excellent gameplay. Was just impatiently waiting for COD Mobile to release officially and after playing it for 5 months I am not disappointed at all. The multiplayer modes are also very amazing to play and the graphics are just mind blowing plus the Battle Royal is the cherry on the cake😊❤.Hope new maps for the Battle Royal comes out soon✌🏻🥰 awesome gameplay and excellent graphics,5
"2nd time reviewing and FINAL! This mobile version gives you that CLASSIC CoD experience you remember and love. I can finally give this game 5 stars. Before, occasionally, I'd receive a phone call/text message and that would mess up the connection during a ranked match and then I get a -40 point penalty for ""leaving"" the match when it was never my fault. Thankfully, you can reconnect to the match. Hands down better than any game in the Play Store!",5
"I really love the game now!!! But I don't play it as much, and usually when I finally decide to play there is an update.. but that's on me. I also missed zombies, well not as much when it first came out, I'm now addicted to zombies. But anyways, I just wanted to say thanks to activition and all those other game company's. Without all you, most games would be boring. Thanks activition keep up the good work!!😁",5
"I love this game it's best multiplayer action ,shooting game this game's modes are of very less time so it also doesn't waste any time of player ,,i play this game when I was bored I play a quick 10 min gAme which relaxes me but when I tried to join beta version it takes a lot of time even it says joining since last 3 days ..even now iam not able to join beta version……. awesome gameplay and excellent graphics",5
"I haven't touched a game counsel since original xbox and playstation, because I just don't have the home time... I wish I could play for years but just couldn't... this is even the first game I've ever downloaded on my phone, and I could not be more pleased with the experience that I've had so far! I don't have a clue and can't speak on as far as how the graphics match up to the game on the council's but I've been blown out of the water with it all, great job to the COD team, and thank you!!!",5
"*New Rating.Unsatisfied.* 1.You should know that most of the users use cellular data playing games and etc. Me too.In this situation 2.1 GB of update installation is some sort of impossible.Sometimes the downloading gets disconnected automatically.*Please do solve it.Either lessen the update installation & make it under 1.5 GB or let us download the game update in parts.Please!!!* 2.Ping is just unbearable. *This game is AWESOME!!! Great graphics,great innovation...""Future Ready"" concept.*",5
"If into shooting games this is the best of its kind .both online and offline , multiplayer many different modes u can play some quick some longer soooo many different guns couple of different classes u can choose from. I what more do u want. Thanks developers for keeping me entertained with a game a dont have to buy into. Ofcourse u get more if u buy into the game but u dont NEED to.5 stars",5
"Never had a console growing up so I missed out on the whole COD experience...until NOW that is. Not the biggest fan of team play, but the Battle Royal feature is amazing . Hardly even play PubG anymore this is so fun. Nice job Activision!!! 😁👍 additional editing 6/11/20 While the next Update installs I'm Updating MY review...again. This game just keeps getting better! And so am l, finished last season at MASTER 4V! Not good for an old Noob.🥴👍",5
Honestly its a really good mobile game probably the best I've played. I love the music and auto aiming is annoying if u don't know know how to use it but once ya learn how to its rly good. Get a good gun for ur playing style dor multiplayer get more on that later but people say battle royal lags but for my phone 📱 no problem don't rly get lag at all in any game but multiplayer is AMAZING u can team up with friends and try new modes that come in every week or so that is it for my review. Bye Thank you,5
"I Love The Game, concept, Graphics, Everything, Etc. But While Playing The Game Screens Getting Black And I Hear Only The Voice of My Co-Player. I don't Know What To Do. And There is No Problem From My Mobile I Also Play PUBG in This No Issues Till Date. I Love This Game More Than PUBG and Everything But Due To This Issue I Can't Play For While. I Have To Close it And Re Open It So That's It's Comes Again. But After some Minutes it Will Again The Screen Go Black. I Don't Kno Why!! awesome gameplay and excellent graphics",5
"Best game on mobile..by far. I spend money when I want, not because I have too. Extraordinary amount of content and graphical design for a phone. Battle Royale is a huge mobile game map that my Google pixel 4 plays seemlessly. As long as your internet connection is par or better this game would have passed on a PlayStation 2/3 console and been excepted by the community as a great game. That being said the file and it's subsequent seasonal gameplay is awesome are large. Memory space my confine you. Thank you",5
"I'm absolutely in love with this game. Definitely stands up to the legendary CoD status.. A story mode* would be the icing on the cake though.. And the battle royale is good but I'm sure they're gonna get better over the gameplay is awesome. Need female characters. Need more guns. Would love to see the addition of p90, the uzi, Scar, MP5, G36, AUG, or the AS50. Double Uzis would be a kick-ass addition! Need more maps in battle royale. Network errors shouldn't result in penalty in ranked matches.",5
Season 7 update is sucks..... They are doing partiality... From very 1st.....if want win a match in battle Royal you have to buy a premium pass. Or they can't let you win..They give the Battle pass holder less damage.... In combat so other can't kill them easily.... And they give more damage.I'm pro player... A legendary rank holder in BR In a match with a b. Pass holder they use emote in a match and I continuously fire him but it didn't effect him.I've more to say bt they don't allow me..,5
"This game is honestly really freaking cool. I play it atleast once a day for the daily rewards. The game rarely crashes now but that's mostly caused by an over heated phone or to many open apps. I have noticed though that when more than 4 players are on my screen it tends to crash. I do wish we could get Cod Points by earning them through game play, I think its kind of a bummer that you can just pay to have the flashy stuff. It is a free app so you gotta make money somewhere i guess. 👏👌",5
"A mobile game done right! If I could only download one mobile game this would be it. You don't have to spend money, but do the gaming industry a favor, spend a few bucks or watch ads so the industry knows this is the quality we expect as consumers. My gratitude to the developers for putting together a great game without constantly trying to take money out of my pocket. This is a great game . awesome gameplay and excellent graphics",5
"This is honestly the best game to ever come on mobile. The devs listen to the community and bans hackers, they are always bringing amazing new gameplay is awesome and made this game soldier based which is cods specialty. Unlike PUBG where there are only new stuff which you have to pay for this isn't p2w. It's your option and this game gives you the best rewards depending on your skill not the amount of money you spend nope no way. People who are f2p players must try this since it has strategy unlike PUBG.",5
Definitely my favorite mobile game. Honestly I only have a few complaints about this game. I wish you could turn your icons when you're changing your hud layout because it limits me on how i can set up my screen. This game is really fun tho i spent over $500 in just May and i don't normally spend money on mobile games. Also i really wish i could get in the beta but it will tell me that im joining for days and never join.,5
"Same lovable game modes and playability adapted to the new systems and generations for even more hooking entertainment and now for free!!!! Plus you can buy extra stuff for that actual swaging new gen love. 10 out of 10. Love the new battle royale, simplified and utterly awesome for the classic xbox cod franchise fans and the new fortnite game mode lover gen.",5
"Game is well made, enjoyable and addictive. Not too hard to get into which is a bonus. Hoping that the developers would bring back the zombie mode... sadly I didn't get to play it. Also please improve the br mode. It needs more playing modes. Atm its boring. Also, the 'kill confirmed' mode should be standardised. I thoroughly enjoyed that. awesome gameplay and excellent graphics",5
"I've played many mobile shooters but by far this is the best one! GREAT GRAPHICS, GREAT CONTROLS, AND LOTS OF FUN. I know some people who complain that mobile games are pay to win, this one ISNT! THE GAME HAS THREE MODES, Zombies, multiplayer, battle royale. (2 for now. Zombies was removed because it lacked quality.) The game Is always improving with gameplay is awesome, new battle passes, and new modes for multiplayer. And the game never gets old. I love this game! Great job developers! Thank you",5
"Hei it's unfair. I archived legend league in BR 6th season. But i didn't get the money they supplied for each league. It's very very unfair😩 I didn't even get the skin for AK-47 which is given in the wc tournement 2020. I like this game. But becouse of these things, it makes me not to play this game. And even i can't get the free draws by watching vdos🥺 Unless graphics and controls are very good. That's why I choose COD MOBILE. Plz, kindly take a step to make this game better. Thank you",5
"Bruh, what can i say like the best mobile game i have played so far, sometimes you lose sometimes you win but you know how to stand up and be the number one, this game is intense, fun, and having constant gameplay is awesome like what more can you want, i recommend this to you ( if you're reading this) and i am not a bot so you can trust me.😁😁",5
"Awesome game, good controls and graphics. Best game i had ever played, you will never be bored, pubg is worst. Boring and hard but cod is a bit easier than pubg. In cod we can get skins according to levels, tiers but in lubv we have to use money real money. Now i conclude by saying that call of duty is the Baap of pubg🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠 season 6 awesome gameplay and excellent graphics",5
The worst thing about this game is lack of multi touch support. I can't play by using three fingers simultaneously. And other thing I noticed is that I am unable to get into the game sometimes as it keeps loading forever. I won't recommended for now but I hopes they fix all this soon.,5
Everything about the game is wonderful but I hate the fact that I do what's necessary to reach a top ranked level in both ranked and battle royale matches to be demoted from elite to rookie in ranked matches and from pro to veteran for battle royale for yet a second time...ITS AGGRAVATING!!!!!!!! please change that thank you,5
Some games are like annoying 😠 and like for the characters we need to pay real money and so stupidity like I don't like those games but this app is so cool . And I am lucky to install this app. The first time I played this app I felt like its the best game I've ever played .👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌I love this game. But it takes a lot of GB. Thank you for the cooperation. awesome gameplay and excellent graphics,5
"It's almost perfect for battle royale just add the following below to be the best game ever: ,please allow us to drive tanks. put death machines on helicopters at the rear passengers compartment. put in military planes and jets as well. Let us dismount death machine from antelope to carry. Put in a version of battle royal with teams to capture lands across the map by holding all the terrian and defeating opponents by bigger teams.Updated to 1000000000 stars cause you put tanks in the game. Thank you",5
"I was skeptical qt first, only because I'm not good, at all, at phone games, just because of the controls. But, I can honestly say that this a one of the, if not THE best phone game I've ever played. CoD has always been my favorite military franchise in any game systems, mainly because of the Campaigns. This cellphone game is on point, and with that being said, I'm about to buy the season pass, because you guys deserve it. Thanks once again, my friends! 😁",5
This is a really good game as I'm already a fan of call of duty also I love the way the multilayer mode works but the battle royale has some problem and as the phone I'm using is an old version. I would like you to fix but other than that everything is good. Thanks a lot for creating COD mobile.,5
Best game out there. Completely free and options to buy skins and stuff. Definitely NOT pay-to-win. Quality game with constant gameplay is awesome and by far the best graphics of any mobile game on any mobile device. Can't say enough good things. It's exactly what you expect from a COD game. Get ready to grind! It's an amazing game...,5
Awesome game best mobile game yet If you don't have this app you need to download it now it has great graphics and awesome game play online you will not want to put it down .it is as close to the console game as you can get on a mobile phone it has some of the best weapon upgrades as well as the scorstreaks and perks I could go on and on so just jump in and find out for yourself don't hesitate come and emerse yourself in one of the best first person shooter games of all time Thanks Activision awesome gameplay and excellent graphics,5
"game crashes in the middle of the game & sometimes getting message as Connecting, cant play properly, please do something for network issues, most times end up on losing side, i did clear cache & re-installed too, issue remained same, but never face any network issues on PUBGMobile, so im taking back my 4 STARS until issues has been cleared.",5
This game is awesome I enjoy playing it the graphics perfect I mean I don't know how else to explain it other than download the game and try it and see for yourself. I mean what do you got to lose try it and don't like it then uninstall it. But I'm telling you you will not be disappointed .I'm addicted to playing Call of Duty mobile it is the best mobile game I have found yet join us and come play😊😄👍👍👍👍 Thank you,5
"How does the bug occur ? Black Screen then game crash Frequency (every match, one in five matches, completely random, etc.) Completely random Modes (only in MP, only in BR, or in all modes) In all modes , main menu . The game doesn't last 10 minutes Potential triggers (does it always occur after you do X action or anything specific) Nothing smecific Device and Version Number Samsung Galaxy A7 2018 / SM-A750FN UID or Username ×LGN×L4T3",5
It's good and easy to get the hang of and all good the battle royal I dont like as much tho its hard to get a hold of. Hard to see places on the map and mini map could do with in proving. Also sometimes when I play multiplayer I lag so i die and cant try to win the battle. (But over all a great game),5
"This is by far the best first person shooter on play store, Apple store...etc. because of Activision. There hard work through out years has made an incredible series of call of duty games that have mind blowing graphics as well as amazingly real there campaigns are. I have been playing call of duty mobile for quite a bit now and not to long ago they removed zombies and I'm rely sad about that. I'm also kind of annoyed that there is not a single cod point is given as a prize ever… awesome gameplay and excellent graphics",5
The game is very good. The mobile game I uave played it's perfect just the way it is but if u can play mix some of the mode together. E.x. u can mix rapid fire with free for all or something similar.
